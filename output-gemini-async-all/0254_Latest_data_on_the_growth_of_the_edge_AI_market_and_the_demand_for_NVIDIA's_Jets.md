## Analysis

NVIDIA is poised to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, with significant attention on its core data center business. However, recent developments in its edge AI platforms, particularly the Jetson and IGX lines, reveal material, non-consensus information that could impact forward-looking guidance and investor perception of diversified growth vectors.

While the data center segment is projected to see moderating growth, the automotive and robotics segments, which heavily leverage edge AI, are expected to accelerate significantly. The general availability and strong early adoption of the new Jetson AGX Thor, coupled with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's strategic emphasis on robotics as a major future growth opportunity, suggest a potential upside to these segments that may be currently overlooked by the broader market.

### Key Findings:

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has developed a “robot brain” that could supercharge the robotics industry. Its Jetson AGX Thor, a robotics chip module, is now available as a developer kit for $3,499. The first kits will ship next month and are designed to create advanced robots. Nvidia says the Jetson AGX Thor is 7.5 times faster than the previous generation and comes with 128GB of memory to support large AI models. The chip is based on Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processor, its latest generation of technology used in AI chips as well as in chips for computer gaming. Bulk orders of over 1,000 units are priced at $2,999 per module."

    *   **Source:** The Indian Express
    *   **Impact:** High. The immediate general availability of Jetson AGX Thor developer kits and production modules, with shipments commencing in September 2025, provides a concrete and near-term revenue driver for NVIDIA's robotics segment. The substantial performance increase (7.5x faster AI compute) and integration of the Blackwell architecture are critical selling points that could accelerate adoption. The specific pricing details for both developer kits and bulk orders offer tangible insight into potential revenue generation. This information is highly material for Q3 FY2026 guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While new NVIDIA product launches are generally anticipated, the precise timing of general availability and initial shipments for Jetson AGX Thor, along with detailed pricing and performance, may not be fully integrated into consensus earnings models, which often prioritize the larger data center segment.

*   **Snippet:** "Today we're launching NVIDIA Jetson Thor into general availability. This milestone comes as we are celebrating the more than 2 million developers now using the NVIDIA robotics stack. These builders are reshaping industries across manufacturing, food delivery, agriculture, healthcare, facilities maintenance and much more. Since the launch of the NVIDIA Jetson platform in 2014, a growing ecosystem of more than 1,000 hardware systems, software and sensor partners have joined the thriving developer community to help enable more than 7,000 customers to adopt edge AI across industries."

    *   **Impact:** Medium-High. The announcement of Jetson Thor's general availability, combined with the robust existing ecosystem of over 2 million developers and 7,000+ customers for the broader Jetson platform, indicates a strong foundation for rapid uptake of the new, more powerful Thor modules. The broad range of industrial applications mentioned underscores the diverse market opportunity for edge AI.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The existence of NVIDIA's robotics ecosystem is generally recognized, but the specific scale of developers and customers, and the implications for accelerated revenue growth in the robotics segment due to the new Thor launch, might be underestimated by analysts primarily focused on the data center.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sees robotics as the company's largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence, which has helped make the Santa Clara–based firm one of the top tech companies. Currently, robotics contributes about 1 per cent of Nvidia's total revenue."
    *   **Date:** August 27, 2025
    *   **Source:** The Indian Express
    *   **Impact:** High. This direct statement from NVIDIA's CEO highlights a significant strategic priority and a long-term growth vector. The fact that robotics currently accounts for only 1% of total revenue, yet is identified as the "largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence," suggests substantial untapped potential and a long runway for expansion. This provides a powerful narrative for future diversification beyond the core data center business.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA's involvement in robotics is known, the specific emphasis from the CEO on it being the *largest growth opportunity outside of AI* and its current *minimal revenue contribution* is a non-consensus insight that could lead to a re-evaluation of this segment's future impact and growth trajectory.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia says production modules and development kits for the next-gen Jetson platform are available, with early adopters including Amazon, Meta, John Deere, OpenAI, and Boston Dynamics. Agility Robotics plans to integrate Thor into its sixth-generation Digit humanoid for warehouse work, and Boston Dynamics is preparing a new Atlas variant to complement Thor."

    *   **Impact:** High. The explicit mention of prominent early adopters, including major tech companies (Amazon, Meta, OpenAI) and leading robotics firms (Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics), provides strong validation for Jetson Thor's capabilities and market readiness. Specific use cases, such as Agility Robotics' Digit for warehouse operations and Boston Dynamics' Atlas, indicate real-world deployment and significant potential for volume orders, which could translate to tangible revenue in upcoming quarters.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While some major customers are known to collaborate with NVIDIA, this specific and recent list of early adopters for Jetson Thor, along with their stated intentions for integration, offers more concrete evidence of demand that might not be fully priced into current analyst expectations.

*   **Snippet:** "Data centre revenue, comprising over 80% of total sales, is projected to moderate from Q1's 73% growth to 54%. Conversely, automotive and robotics segments are expected to accelerate to 80% YoY growth, powered by new products including NVIDIA Halos safety systems for autonomous vehicles and Isaac, the world's first open humanoid robot foundation model."
