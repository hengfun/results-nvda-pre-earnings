## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on NVIDIA's (NVDA) compliant chips for the Chinese market, focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact its Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's strategy for the crucial Chinese AI chip market is currently navigating a highly complex and volatile landscape. While the company has been actively developing and seeking approval for compliant chips, recent developments present significant headwinds that could impact its Q2 FY2026 results and, more critically, its forward-looking guidance.

The most striking and potentially non-consensus information revolves around the H20 chip, which was designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions and recently received U.S. approval for resumed sales to China, albeit with a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government. However, within the last week, reports indicate that the Chinese government has urged domestic firms to cease using H20 chips due to alleged security risks, leading NVIDIA to reportedly halt H20 production. This creates a direct contradiction to the previously perceived "resumption of sales" and introduces substantial uncertainty and potential revenue loss for NVIDIA in the Chinese market.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA is developing a new, more powerful compliant chip, the B30A, based on its Blackwell architecture. While this signals a long-term commitment to the Chinese market, its expected release of samples in September 2025 means it will not contribute to Q2 FY2026 earnings. The immediate challenge remains the H20 situation and the broader geopolitical tensions, which could lead to a more cautious outlook from management regarding China revenue. The market may have priced in the H20 sales resumption, but the recent Chinese government's stance and NVIDIA's production halt introduce a new, negative variable that could surprise investors.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1: Chinese Government Urges Halt on H20 Chip Use & NVIDIA Halts Production**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has ordered suppliers like Samsung and Amkor to halt production of the H20 AI chip, following a request from the Chinese government. This comes after Nvidia and AMD received US approval to sell lower-end AI chips to China, with a revenue cut to the government." "The order by Nvidia comes shortly after the Chinese government urged local companies to stop using the H20 chip due to security concerns." "Nvidia responded by temporarily halting H20 chip production, a precautionary measure that ensures the company remains compliant with evolving regulatory frameworks."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025, August 23, 2025, August 24, 2025
*   **Source:** Mint, "Nvidia orders suppliers to halt production of China-specific H20 AI chips after Beijing crackdown: Report"; AzerNews, "Nvidia halts production of China-specific AI chips amid regulatory pressure"; Mitrade, "China Warns Against Nvidia H20 Chips: Here's Why That Won't Stop the AI Leader"; TrendPulse Finance, "Nvidia stocks in focus as Jensen Huang asks suppliers to halt H20 chip work"
*   **Impact:** High. This is a significant, immediate negative development. Despite recent U.S. approval for H20 sales, the Chinese government's directive and NVIDIA's subsequent production halt directly impact NVIDIA's ability to generate revenue from its currently compliant chip in a major market. This could lead to a downward revision of China-related revenue expectations for Q3 FY226 and beyond, and potentially impact Q2 results if any previously expected H20 shipments were affected late in the quarter.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While the U.S. approval and revenue-sharing deal for H20 were widely reported, the subsequent Chinese government warning and NVIDIA's production halt are very recent and contradict the "resumption of sales" narrative, making it a non-consensus development that could surprise the market.

**Finding 2: Development of New Blackwell-based China-Compliant Chip (B30A) with September 2025 Sample Target**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia is creating a new artificial intelligence chip for the Chinese market, reportedly codenamed B30A, is designed to provide more power than Nvidia's current H20 model, which is sold in China. The B30A chip is said to be based on Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture but will deliver about half the computing power of the company's flagship B300 GPU..." "Final specifications haven't been locked in, but the company hopes to send samples to Chinese customers for testing as early as next month."
*   **Date:** August 19, 2025, August 26, 2025, August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** Alpha Spread, "Nvidia Developing New AI Chip for Chinese Market Amid Export Restrictions"; Outlook Business, "Nvidia Plans to Build China-Specific B30A AI Chip, Balancing Export Curbs and Market Demand"; AI News, "New Nvidia Blackwell chip for China may outpace H20 model"; Investopedia, "Nvidia Considering 'Variety of Products' as New China AI Chip Details Emerge"
*   **Impact:** Medium. While the B30A is a positive long-term strategic move for NVIDIA to maintain its presence in China, its impact on Q2 FY2026 earnings is negligible as samples are only expected in September 2025. The material impact will be on forward-looking guidance for future quarters (Q3 FY226 and beyond) and the company's ability to regain market share lost due to restrictions.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. Discussions about NVIDIA developing new compliant chips for China have been ongoing, and the B30A codename and Blackwell architecture basis are becoming more public. The "next month" for samples is relatively new but aligns with expectations of a future product.

**Finding 3: H20 Sales Resumption with 15% Revenue-Sharing Agreement**

*   **Snippet:** "A significant development emerged in August 2025 where NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to share 15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licences. This arrangement allows NVIDIA to resume H20 AI chip sales designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export controls." "President Donald Trump has recently greenlit Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) to resume selling its chips to China on the condition that it'll share 15% of China revenue with the US government."
*   **Date:** August 19, 2025, August 21, 2025, August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** Alpha Spread, "Nvidia Developing New AI Chip for Chinese Market Amid Export Restrictions"; Investopedia, "Nvidia Considering 'Variety of Products' as New China AI Chip Details Emerge"; IG AE, "NVIDIA Q2 2026 earnings preview: AI growth, China chip deal, analyst forecast"
*   **Impact:** Medium. This agreement was initially seen as a positive for NVIDIA, allowing it to re-enter the Chinese market with the H20. However, the subsequent Chinese government's warning and NVIDIA's production halt (Finding 1) significantly diminish the immediate positive impact of this deal. The 15% revenue share would have impacted gross margins, but the lack of sales due to the halt makes this a moot point for now.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The agreement for NVIDIA and AMD to pay a 15% revenue share to the U.S. government for China sales was a major news item in August 2025.

---

**Finding 4: China Market's Importance and Prior Financial Impact of Restrictions**

*   **Snippet:** "China represents 13% of NVIDIA's revenue by customer billing location in FY 2025, actual contribution may be higher due to trans-shipment orders." "Four months after the Trump administration banned sales of chips to China, a Financial Times report indicates that groups within the Chinese government are advocating to ban Chinese companies from purchasing Nvidia's (NVDA) H20 chips. Is Nvidia shut out of the Chinese market for good? It's a multibillion-dollar question for the chip maker, as 13.1% of Nvidia's revenues - $17.1 billion - came from China last year." "new licensing requirements for H20 chip exports to China triggered a $4.5 billion charge, causing gross margins to plunge to 60.5% from the expected 70.6%."
*   **Date:** August 21, 2025, August 22, 2025, August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** IG AE, "NVIDIA Q2 2026 earnings preview: AI growth, China chip deal, analyst forecast"; Morningstar, "Will Nvidia be able to sell to China? Wall Street can't agree."; Seeking Alpha, "Nvidia: Buying Access To China's AI Chip Market"
*   **Impact:** High. The China market is a significant revenue driver for NVIDIA, and past restrictions have already had a material financial impact. The ongoing uncertainty and recent negative developments (Finding 1) underscore the continued risk and potential for further financial charges or reduced guidance related to this market.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The importance of the Chinese market and the financial impact of past U.S. export restrictions on NVIDIA are well-understood by analysts and investors.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The most significant contradiction is the recent reports of the Chinese government urging a halt on H20 chip usage and NVIDIA's subsequent production halt, directly conflicting with earlier reports of the U.S. government approving the resumption of H20 sales to China under a revenue-sharing agreement. This creates a highly uncertain and negative outlook for NVIDIA's immediate China revenue.
*   **Gap:** While samples for the B30A are expected in September 2025, there's no clear indication of a mass production or general availability timeline, nor specific pricing or expected revenue contribution. The actual approval process from the U.S. government for the B30A is also a key unknown. The long-term success of the B30A will also depend on its competitive performance against local Chinese alternatives like Huawei, especially given the current sentiment against U.S. chips.
