## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the focus is on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding advanced packaging tool demand from semiconductor equipment suppliers. NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report is due today, August 27, 2025. Recent commentary from key suppliers like Lam Research and Applied Materials, along with insights into TSMC's advanced packaging capacity, provides crucial context.

The overarching theme is a strong and sustained demand for advanced packaging, primarily driven by the insatiable appetite for AI and High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). Equipment suppliers are reporting robust performance and specific product wins in this segment, while TSMC, a critical partner for NVIDIA, continues to grapple with and expand its CoWoS capacity. A nuanced point emerges regarding TSMC's internal reorganization of some advanced packaging facilities, suggesting potential optimization amidst overall expansion.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

The semiconductor equipment industry is experiencing a significant uplift, largely fueled by the AI boom and the increasing complexity of advanced packaging. Both Lam Research and Applied Materials, key players in providing tools for chip manufacturing, have highlighted advanced packaging as a primary growth driver. Lam Research, in particular, reported record revenues and profitability in Q2 FY2025, with its advanced packaging revenue on an upward trajectory. The company expects its SABRE 3D advanced packaging systems to gain nearly 5 points of market share year-on-year in calendar 2025, a strong indicator of its competitive positioning and the segment's robust demand. Furthermore, Lam's Akara etch tool is seeing early adoption for HBM production, a critical component for NVIDIA's AI GPUs. The shift to more advanced packaging, such as 4D, is noted to require approximately 30% more wafers, directly translating to higher demand for fabrication equipment.

Applied Materials echoes this positive sentiment, reporting that its advanced packaging business has quadrupled revenue over the past five years and expressing high confidence in its continued growth. A key insight from Applied Materials is that HBM chip production is three times more wafer-intensive than standard DRAM due to lower bit density and the necessity of 3D stacking. This directly drives increased demand for their advanced packaging tools. Applied Materials is also innovating with new Digital Lithography Technology (DLT) aimed at next-generation advanced packaging for large AI/HPC packages.

On the customer side, TSMC, NVIDIA's primary foundry partner, continues to face immense demand for its CoWoS advanced packaging, which is explicitly identified as a "choke point" for AI capacity. Despite ongoing efforts to expand capacity, TSMC's management confirmed they are actively trying to "narrow the gap" between supply and strong demand. While the overall narrative is one of aggressive expansion (with plans to quadruple CoWoS capacity by 2026 and increasing quotations), a recent report noted TSMC's reorganization of some Advanced Packaging 5 Factory (AP5) facilities due to "declining capacity utilization rates." This could indicate a fine-tuning of operations or a shift in focus for specific packaging types rather than a systemic slowdown in CoWoS for AI, but it presents a slightly more complex picture than a simple linear growth story.

For NVIDIA, the consistent and strong demand for advanced packaging tools, coupled with the increased wafer intensity for HBM, suggests a robust underlying market for its AI accelerators. The continued efforts by TSMC to expand CoWoS capacity, despite it remaining a bottleneck, indicates that NVIDIA's ability to secure this critical packaging will remain a key determinant of its revenue growth. The specific product wins and market share gains by equipment suppliers in advanced packaging further validate the strong investment cycle in this area.
