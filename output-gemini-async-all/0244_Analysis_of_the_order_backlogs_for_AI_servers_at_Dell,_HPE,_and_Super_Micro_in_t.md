## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the order backlogs for AI servers at Dell, HPE, and Super Micro, focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The demand for AI servers, and consequently NVIDIA's GPUs, remains exceptionally strong, as evidenced by the substantial order backlogs reported by key partners Dell and HPE. Dell Technologies reported a significant $3.8 billion order backlog for its AI-optimized systems as of mid-August 2025, following $3.1 billion in AI server shipments in Q2 FY2025. This indicates robust and sustained demand that is even leading analysts to project full-year AI server sales for Dell above its own guidance. Similarly, HPE reported a $3.2 billion backlog for AI sales as of early June 2025, alongside $1.1 billion in AI sales for Q2 2025. HPE also secured a notable $1 billion AI server contract with X (formerly Twitter), highlighting its competitive strength in the market.

A particularly material and potentially non-consensus piece of information is the reported redirection of NVIDIA chip supply. Industry dynamics suggest that NVIDIA has been reallocating chip supply from Super Micro to more stable partners like Dell. This shift is attributed to Super Micro's operational difficulties, including a Department of Justice investigation and the resignation of their auditor. This redirection could significantly benefit Dell and HPE by providing them with a more consistent supply of NVIDIA's high-demand GPUs, allowing them to fulfill their substantial backlogs more effectively. For NVIDIA, this indicates a proactive management of its supply chain to ensure chips reach partners capable of reliable delivery, which could positively impact its revenue recognition and overall guidance, especially if Super Micro's issues were previously a bottleneck. The lack of recent, specific backlog figures for Super Micro in the search results further supports the notion of potential challenges for the company.

Overall, the strong backlogs at Dell and HPE underscore the continued robust demand for NVIDIA's AI accelerators. The reported shift in NVIDIA's chip allocation strategy from Super Micro to other partners represents a material, non-consensus development that could enhance NVIDIA's ability to meet market demand through its more stable channels, potentially leading to upside in its forward-looking guidance.

### Structured Findings

**Finding 1: Dell's Substantial AI Server Backlog**

*   **Snippet:** "Dell Technologies, which provides IT solutions including servers, storage, networking, and personal computing devices to businesses and consumers worldwide, has been leveraging the AI infrastructure boom to drive its growth. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company achieved an 80% year-over-year revenue growth in servers and networking sales, reaching $7.7 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a strategic shift towards premium AI-optimized systems, which generated $3.1 billion in AI server shipments and a $3.8 billion order backlog."
*   **Date:** August 17, 2025
*   **Source:** AInvest, [https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/reiteration/25/08/47159968/dell-poised-to-ride-ai-server-boom-toward-higher-](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/reiteration/25/08/47159968/dell-poised-to-ride-ai-server-boom-toward-higher-)
*   **Impact:** High. A $3.8 billion backlog for AI servers indicates very strong and sustained demand for the underlying NVIDIA GPUs. This provides a clear revenue pipeline for NVIDIA through Dell and suggests potential for Dell to exceed its own guidance, which would be positive for NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that AI server demand is high, but the specific, recent dollar amount of Dell's backlog and its implications for exceeding guidance might be less widely disseminated in pre-earnings analysis.

**Finding 2: HPE's Significant AI Sales and Backlog**

*   **Snippet:** "Hybrid cloud revenue reported double-digit YoY growth for three consecutive quarters; AI sales totaled $1.1 billion with a $3.2 billion backlog. HPE forecasts Q3 revenue of $8.2–8.5 billion and full-year growth of 7–9%, driven by large AI deals and enterprise adoption."
*   **Date:** June 5, 2025
*   **Source:** alobbs.com, [https://alobbs.com/2025-06-05-briefing/](https://alobbs.com/2025-06-05-briefing/)
*   **Impact:** High. A $3.2 billion backlog for AI sales at HPE further confirms robust demand for NVIDIA's components. HPE's strong Q2 AI sales and positive Q3 forecast, driven by AI, directly translate to continued strong orders for NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Similar to Dell, the general trend of strong AI demand is known, but the specific backlog figure and its contribution to HPE's forecast could be a more granular, less consensus detail.

**Finding 3: NVIDIA Chip Supply Redirection from Super Micro to Dell**

*   **Snippet:** "The company reported $3.1 billion in AI server sales in recent financial results, representing an 80% quarter-over-quarter increase while building a substantial $3.8 billion backlog of AI server orders1. This remarkable growth coincides with Supermicro's operational difficulties, including a Department of Justice investigation and their auditor's resignation, which has weakened customer confidence2. Industry dynamics have shifted, with Nvidia reportedly redirecting chip supply from Supermicro to more stable partners like Dell, reinforcing Dell's market position2."
*   **Date:** May 20, 2025
*   **Source:** Tech in Asia, [https://www.techinasia.com/dell-unveils-ai-servers-nvidia-chips-enterprises](https://www.techinasia.com/dell-unveils-ai-servers-nvidia-chips-enterprises)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a material, non-consensus piece of information. The redirection of NVIDIA's chip supply from Super Micro to Dell (and potentially other stable partners like HPE) due to Super Micro's operational issues suggests NVIDIA is actively managing its supply chain to ensure its GPUs reach the market through reliable channels. This could mitigate any potential negative impact from Super Micro's difficulties on NVIDIA's overall sales and could lead to stronger-than-expected performance from Dell and HPE, benefiting NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** This information about NVIDIA specifically redirecting supply due to a partner's operational issues is likely non-consensus and could be a significant driver for NVIDIA's ability to meet demand and for the relative performance of its partners.

**Finding 4: HPE Winning Large AI Server Contract against Competition**

*   **Snippet:** "Industry dynamics have shifted, with Nvidia reportedly redirecting chip supply from Supermicro to more stable partners like Dell, reinforcing Dell's market position2. The server competition remains fierce though, as evidenced by HPE winning a significant $1 billion AI server contract with X (formerly Twitter) in direct competition with Dell and Supermicro3."
*   **Date:** May 20, 2025
*   **Source:** Tech in Asia, [https://www.techinasia.com/dell-unveils-ai-servers-nvidia-chips-enterprises](https://www.techinasia.com/dell-unveils-ai-servers-nvidia-chips-enterprises)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While the $1 billion contract itself is significant for HPE, its impact on NVIDIA is indirect but positive, indicating strong demand for AI servers that likely incorporate NVIDIA GPUs. The competitive win against Dell and Supermicro highlights the intense market for AI infrastructure.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general competitive landscape is known, but this specific large contract win by HPE against direct competitors might be a less widely reported detail that underscores the robust demand for high-end AI server solutions.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Super Micro Backlog:** A significant gap is the lack of recent, specific order backlog figures for Super Micro. The information about NVIDIA redirecting chip supply due to Super Micro's operational difficulties implies a potential negative impact on Super Micro's ability to secure and fulfill new orders, but concrete numbers are missing from the recent search results. This gap makes it difficult to quantify the full impact on Super Micro and, by extension, the precise benefit to Dell and HPE.
*   **NVIDIA's Direct Commentary:** The findings are based on partner reports and industry observations. Direct commentary from NVIDIA on its supply chain adjustments or specific partner performance related to backlogs would provide more definitive insights.
*   **GPU Specificity:** While "AI servers" and "AI-optimized systems" strongly imply NVIDIA GPUs, the snippets don't always explicitly state "NVIDIA GPUs" in every instance of backlog reporting. However, given NVIDIA's dominance in the AI accelerator market, this is a reasonable inference.
