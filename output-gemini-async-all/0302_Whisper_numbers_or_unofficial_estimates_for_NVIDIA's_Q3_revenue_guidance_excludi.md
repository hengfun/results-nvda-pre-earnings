## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings and provide Q3 FY2026 guidance after market close today, August 27, 2025, material non-consensus information suggests that the company's forward-looking revenue guidance for Q3 FY2026 is likely to exclude direct revenue from China. This exclusion, driven by ongoing U.S. export restrictions and licensing uncertainties, could lead to a significant difference from broader market expectations.

KeyBanc Capital Markets has been a prominent voice in this analysis, predicting that NVIDIA's Q3 guidance could be lower than the consensus due to these uncertainties. The brokerage explicitly noted that NVIDIA's outlook might "exclude direct revenue from China given pending license approvals and uncertainty on timing." If sales from China were to be included, it could potentially boost revenues by an additional $2-3 billion. This aligns with a statement made by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang in June 2025, where he announced that the company would exclude China from its revenue and profit forecasts due to strict U.S. export restrictions on AI chips.

This potential exclusion of China revenue from guidance follows a precedent set in NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 earnings report (released May 28, 2025), where the Q2 FY2026 revenue outlook of $45.0 billion (plus or minus 2%) already reflected an estimated loss of approximately $8.0 billion in H20 revenue due to export control limitations.

While some broader market expectations for NVIDIA's Q3 revenue range from $52.5 billion to $57 billion, with specific consensus estimates around $45.92 billion and $1.01 EPS, KeyBanc has already reduced its Q3 revenue forecast to $50.4 billion and its EPS estimate to $1.14, specifically citing China-related headwinds and a potential 15% tax on Chinese chip sales. This suggests that even analyst estimates are beginning to factor in the China impact, but the explicit exclusion in NVIDIA's official guidance would be a more definitive signal.

Despite these challenges, KeyBanc also highlighted solid fundamental drivers for NVIDIA, including a 40% increase in GPU supply in F2Q, projected to rise another 20% in F3Q with the ramp of the Blackwell (B200) architecture. The more advanced Blackwell Ultra (B300) chip is also scheduled to begin shipping in the October quarter and could account for half of total Blackwell deliveries.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "KeyBanc forecasts that revenue forecasts might exclude direct income from China due to pending license approvals and timing uncertainties. This exclusion could mean a loss of an estimated $2-3 billion in revenues for Nvidia if China's sales are not considered in their financial projections."

    *   **Impact:** High. This directly addresses the query for revenue guidance *excluding China* and provides a specific financial impact. If NVIDIA explicitly excludes this, it will likely lead to a lower headline guidance number than many might implicitly expect.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked by some, but increasingly recognized by analysts like KeyBanc. The explicit statement from NVIDIA would be non-consensus for the broader market.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia CEO Jensen Wang announced the company will exclude China from its revenue and profit forecasts due to strict U.S. export restrictions."

    *   **Impact:** High. A direct statement from the CEO confirming the exclusion of China from forecasts is a definitive, material piece of information that will shape guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is a direct corporate statement, making it a definitive piece of information. Its full implications on analyst models might still be evolving.

*   **Snippet:** "Currently, market expectations for Nvidia's third-quarter revenue stand at 45.92 billion dollars, with an expected earnings per share of 1.01 dollars."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-21
    *   **Source:** AInvest, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGx1iyBkX1CdJ-rh5q9GejgLBiWnN5cGBLv82mM9J2sJBGu28BhCRZaVgJ-3SZPe3sTGMr_W68NkmonZzH5YPHxm695Abi2pxvDWcpKTRunAEHuMtud3OQSbIib7QQGCB1h_vEAbH6nxzv4o6Mrs2i7gZPew0sN201gryCfe9h9miWKRFJ46YHWVvEJKr3r2g1qX2qCphAmaE=
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This provides a baseline "consensus" figure. If NVIDIA's guidance explicitly excludes China, the reported guidance will likely be lower than this figure, highlighting the impact of the exclusion.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This represents a general market expectation, which may or may not fully account for the explicit exclusion of China revenue.

*   **Snippet:** "However, for Q3, KeyBanc reduced its revenue forecast to $50.4 billion and its EPS estimate to $1.14, citing the impact of China-related headwinds and a 15% fee on Chinese chip sales to the US government."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This is an updated analyst estimate that *does* factor in China headwinds, providing a more refined "non-consensus" view compared to broader market expectations. The specific mention of a 15% fee is also a new detail.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is a revised analyst estimate, moving towards a more non-consensus view by explicitly accounting for China-related impacts.

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion , plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
    *   **Date:** 2025-05-28
    *   **Source:** Earnings Whispers, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG4S7OEBSz0fhfBOaEBTObUkbvPnKkV5TL0v2gufDnnDSGIpMIolhXtDwSac4XnlkmTuXzHgBUlH1aVBw8ecO-zkoxh5gb1UEPoL05oXk_2Zs0QfcLtKZsSXZwH9NUFIu5c1A==
    *   **Impact:** Medium. While this pertains to Q2 guidance, it establishes a clear precedent for NVIDIA explicitly quantifying and reflecting the impact of China export controls in its official outlook. This makes it highly probable they will do the same for Q3.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This was NVIDIA's official guidance for Q2, so it is consensus for that period. Its relevance here is in setting expectations for how Q3 guidance will be presented.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** There isn't a direct contradiction, but a divergence between general market expectations (which might not fully discount China revenue) and the more specific analyst views (like KeyBanc's) and the CEO's stated intention to exclude China from forecasts.
*   **Gaps:** The exact magnitude of the "excluding China" revenue for Q3 FY2026 is still a range ($2-3 billion). The precise methodology NVIDIA will use to present its guidance (e.g., providing a total guidance and then a separate note on China impact, or simply excluding it from the headline number) is not explicitly stated in these snippets, though the CEO's statement suggests a direct exclusion. There's also no specific "whisper number" for the *ex-China* Q3 revenue, only the potential *impact* of the exclusion.
