## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, recent commentary from specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda Labs indicates robust demand and active deployment of Blackwell GPUs. While specific "pre-order volumes" from these niche players are not explicitly quantified in recent reports, their public statements and operational updates within the last three months strongly suggest that Blackwell systems are being rapidly integrated into their infrastructure to meet surging AI-intensive workload demand. A notable non-consensus point highlights potential risks in CoreWeave's ability to fully monetize its Blackwell purchases, which could introduce a nuanced perspective to the otherwise overwhelmingly positive demand narrative.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Structured Findings:**

-   **Snippet:** "As the first company to scale Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, CoreWeave is meeting the strongest demand encountered to date for AI-intensive workload infrastructure, said CEO Michael Intrator."
    -   **Date:** 2025-08-22
    -   **Source:** TECHi, "Nvidia vs CoreWeave: Which AI Stock Is the Better Investment in 2025?"
    -   **Impact:** High. A direct statement from CoreWeave's CEO confirms unprecedented demand for Blackwell, indicating strong and ongoing revenue generation for NVIDIA from this key specialized cloud partner. This reinforces the bullish outlook for Blackwell adoption.
    -   **Consensus Check:** While high demand for Blackwell is generally known, a specific quote from a partner CEO emphasizing "strongest demand encountered to date" provides a material, recent, and potentially overlooked reinforcement of the demand narrative.

-   **Snippet:** "CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) said it has become the first cloud platform to make Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances generally available."
    -   **Date:** 2025-07-09
    -   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, "CoreWeave starts offering Nvidia's RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs at scale"
    -   **Impact:** Medium-High. The general availability of RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell instances signifies that pre-orders are translating into active deployments and revenue recognition for NVIDIA. CoreWeave's claim of being the "first cloud platform" to offer these highlights its aggressive adoption and NVIDIA's successful delivery to a key partner.
    -   **Consensus Check:** CoreWeave's early adoption of Blackwell is generally anticipated, but the specific mention of RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances becoming generally available provides a concrete, recent data point on the operationalization of these advanced GPUs.

-   **Snippet:** "With the launch of RTX PRO 6000, CoreWeave now offers one of the widest ranges of Nvidia Blackwell infrastructure on the market, including the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system and NVIDIA HGX B200 platform, CoreWeave noted." and "Driven by the OpenAI expansion and new wins across enterprises and AI startups, CRWV's contracted backlog reached $30.1 billion, up $4 billion sequentially and doubling year to date."
    -   **Date:** 2025-07-09 (for RTX PRO 6000 launch), 2025-08-26 (for backlog)
    -   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, "CoreWeave starts offering Nvidia's RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs at scale"; Barchart.com, "CoreWeave's Upbeat Outlook: Are Expanding Data Centers At The Core?"
    -   **Impact:** High. CoreWeave's expanded Blackwell offerings, coupled with a substantial and rapidly growing contracted backlog of $30.1 billion, directly indicates robust underlying demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs. This significant backlog growth is a strong forward-looking indicator for NVIDIA's revenue from this segment.
    -   **Consensus Check:** The breadth of Blackwell infrastructure offered by CoreWeave and the specific, large, and increasing contracted backlog figure are material data points that may not be fully factored into all analyst models, especially the sequential and year-to-date growth.

-   **Snippet:** "Lambda, the Superintelligence Cloud, has deployed a broad portfolio of Supermicro GPU-optimized servers including NVIDIA Blackwell based systems to expand its AI infrastructure and deliver high-performance systems to its customers."
    -   **Date:** 2025-08-25
    -   **Source:** Barchart.com, "Lambda Builds AI Factories With Supermicro NVIDIA Blackwell GPU Server Clusters To Deliver Production-Ready Next-Gen AI Infrastructure At Scale"
    -   **Impact:** Medium-High. This confirms that another specialized cloud provider, Lambda Labs, is actively deploying Blackwell systems. This indicates that NVIDIA's supply chain is effectively delivering to these partners, translating pre-orders into operational capacity and revenue.
    -   **Consensus Check:** While Lambda's intention to deploy Blackwell was known, this recent confirmation of actual deployment within days of NVIDIA's earnings provides a fresh and timely data point on the execution of the Blackwell rollout beyond just CoreWeave.

-   **Snippet:** "This accordingly exposes a significant gap in the recoverability of CoreWeave's planned GPU purchases this year, which will be primarily represented by Nvidia's newest Blackwell systems."
    -   **Date:** 2025-08-25
    -   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, "CoreWeave's Q2 2025 10Q Exposes 4 Overlooked Risks (NASDAQ:CRWV)"
    -   **Impact:** Medium. This is a crucial non-consensus finding. While CoreWeave is making substantial Blackwell purchases, this analysis suggests a potential risk regarding their ability to fully monetize these investments through long-term customer commitments. If CoreWeave faces challenges in recovering these costs, it could indirectly impact future NVIDIA orders from them or signal broader market saturation/competition in the specialized AI cloud sector.
    -   **Consensus Check:** This is explicitly presented as an "overlooked risk" in a specialized financial analysis, making it highly non-consensus. It offers a nuanced, potentially cautionary perspective that contrasts with the generally optimistic narrative surrounding Blackwell demand.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Recent commentary from specialized cloud providers CoreWeave and Lambda Labs, published within the last three months, paints a picture of strong and accelerating adoption of NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs. CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, explicitly stated that the company is experiencing the "strongest demand encountered to date" for AI infrastructure, directly linking this to their scaling of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. This sentiment is further supported by CoreWeave's announcement in July 2025 that it has become the first cloud platform to make NVIDIA's RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances generally available, indicating that pre-orders are rapidly moving into active deployment. The company has also expanded its Blackwell offerings to include a wide range of infrastructure, such as the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system and NVIDIA HGX B200 platform. Critically, CoreWeave's contracted backlog surged to $30.1 billion by late August 2025, representing a $4 billion sequential increase and a doubling year-to-date, largely driven by expansion with OpenAI and new enterprise clients. This substantial and growing backlog underscores the robust demand for the underlying NVIDIA Blackwell hardware.

Similarly, Lambda Labs, another specialized cloud provider, confirmed in late August 2025 that it has deployed a broad portfolio of Supermicro GPU-optimized servers, including NVIDIA Blackwell-based systems, to expand its AI infrastructure. This indicates that NVIDIA is successfully delivering Blackwell systems to multiple key partners, translating strong pre-order interest into tangible deployments.

**Non-Consensus Information and Gaps:**

While the overall narrative is one of overwhelming demand and successful deployment, a notable non-consensus point emerges from a Seeking Alpha analysis of CoreWeave's Q2 2025 10Q. This analysis highlights a "significant gap in the recoverability of CoreWeave's planned GPU purchases this year, which will be primarily represented by Nvidia's newest Blackwell systems." This suggests that despite CoreWeave's aggressive acquisition of Blackwell GPUs, there might be underlying challenges in securing long-term revenue commitments to fully offset these substantial investments. This overlooked risk could potentially temper the unbridled optimism surrounding NVIDIA's demand, as issues with a major partner's monetization could indirectly impact future order volumes or payment terms.

A potential gap in the recent commentary (within the last 3 months) is the lack of explicit updates regarding the overheating and connectivity issues with Blackwell GB200 racks reported in January 2025. While this information falls outside the 3-month filter, its initial materiality suggests that any recent resolution or ongoing impact would be highly relevant. The current positive deployment news from CoreWeave and Lambda suggests these issues may have been addressed, but explicit confirmation within the recent timeframe is absent.
