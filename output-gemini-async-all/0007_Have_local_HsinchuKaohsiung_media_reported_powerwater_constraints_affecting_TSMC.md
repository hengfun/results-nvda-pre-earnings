## Analysis

**Analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA) Pre-Earnings Research: TSMC Advanced Packaging Constraints**

As of August 27, 2025, with NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report due after market close, research into potential power and water constraints affecting TSMC's advanced packaging (CoWoS) output in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung has yielded no direct, non-consensus reports from local media or government sources indicating a material impact this quarter. While general concerns about CoWoS capacity bottlenecks persist, and TSMC is actively managing water resources, there is no specific evidence of recent, localized power or water shortages disrupting advanced packaging production in the specified regions during the May-July 2025 period.

The available information suggests that TSMC is proactively addressing resource management and expanding its advanced packaging capabilities. However, the core of the research query—identifying *material, non-consensus information* about *actual power/water constraints* affecting CoWoS output in Hsinchu/Kaohsiung this quarter, as reported by local media or government notices—remains unconfirmed by the conducted searches.

**Key Findings and Assessment:**

1.  **General CoWoS Capacity Bottleneck (Consensus):** Multiple reports indicate that TSMC's CoWoS capacity remains a bottleneck despite aggressive expansion plans, and AI chip output is expected to be constrained through 2025. This is a widely acknowledged industry challenge and is likely already factored into market expectations for NVIDIA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known.

2.  **TSMC's Proactive Water Management (Consensus/Mitigation):** TSMC's 2024 Sustainability Report (published August 20, 2025) details significant investments and initiatives in water resource management, including the operation of reclaimed water plants in Tainan and plans for facilities in Kaohsiung (Qiaotou Reclaimed Water Plant by 2026) and Hsinchu (Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant Project initiated in 2023). These efforts aim to enhance water efficiency and reduce reliance on tap water, indicating a proactive approach to potential water scarcity.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Likely known, reflects ongoing corporate sustainability efforts.

3.  **Historical Power Supply Risks (General Risk, Not Current Constraint):** A re-published 2018 TSMC Annual Report (August 3, 2025) highlights the general risk of power shortages or interruptions, potentially exacerbated by Taiwan's goal to be nuclear-free by 2025. This is a long-term, systemic risk rather than a specific, reported constraint impacting advanced packaging output this quarter.
    *   **Consensus Check:** General industry risk, not a specific, recent event.

4.  **"Anti-Heat" Drills and Hypothetical Outages (Preparedness, Not Actual Event):** A Focus Taiwan article from July 22, 2025, reports on an "anti-heat" drill in Taiwan, including Hsinchu City, to prepare for extreme heat and potential "heat-induced electricity and water outages." This indicates governmental preparedness for potential issues, but does not report actual outages or impacts on industrial production.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked as a direct impact, but the underlying concern about extreme weather is known.

5.  **Civil Defense Drills (Temporary, Planned Disruption):** Taiwan News reported on July 15, 2025, about civil defense air raid drills in Kaohsiung and Hsinchu, which include instructions to turn off electricity, water, and gas. These are temporary, planned exercises and not indicative of ongoing resource constraints affecting industrial output.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Known as a national exercise, not a production constraint.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **No Direct Local Media Reports:** Despite targeting local Hsinchu/Kaohsiung media (UDN, Liberty Times) and government bulletins, no specific articles or notices from the last three months were found that directly report power or water constraints *affecting TSMC's advanced packaging output* in these regions.
*   **Focus on Mitigation vs. Constraint:** The available information from TSMC itself (sustainability report) focuses on their efforts to *mitigate* water risks and expand capacity, rather than reporting current operational constraints due to resource shortages.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the conducted research, there is no material, non-consensus information from local Hsinchu/Kaohsiung media or government notices indicating that power or water constraints have specifically impacted TSMC's advanced packaging (CoWoS) output this quarter (May-July 2025). While the general tightness in CoWoS capacity is a known factor, and Taiwan faces long-term resource management challenges, no recent, specific disruptions directly attributable to power or water shortages in the target regions have been identified. Therefore, it is unlikely that such constraints would be a significant, *non-consensus* factor impacting NVIDIA's upcoming earnings or guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

-   **Snippet:** "Despite aggressive expansions, TSMC's CoWoS capacity remains a bottleneck. The company initially targeted 80,000 wafers per month by 2026 but accelerated to achieve this by 2025—a 12-fold increase from 2021 levels. Yet even this surge may not suffice. Morgan Stanley estimates that TSMC's AI chip shipments will grow 12-fold by 2025, driven by hyperscalers and cloud giants. The gap between supply and demand is widening. TSMC admits AI chip output will remain constrained through 2025, with delays pushing back shipments for major clients like NVIDIA."

    *   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (original source not explicitly stated in snippet, but appears to be an analysis of TSMC's capacity)
    *   **Impact:** High. Reasoning: Directly states CoWoS capacity is a bottleneck impacting NVIDIA shipments through 2025.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known.

-   **Snippet:** "TSMC is committed to maximizing the efficient use of every drop of water. In addition to implementing water-saving measures in manufacturing processes, TSMC actively invests in the development of reclaimed water technologies. ... In 2024, TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant, Yongkang Water Resource Recycling Center, and Anping Reclaimed Water Plant collectively supplied 67 thousand m3 of recycled water daily. The Tainan fabs cumulatively consumed 19.65 million m3 of reclaimed water, reducing tap water consumption by 31%. TSMC is committed to further increasing the use of reclaimed water, with municipal reclaimed water being a key component of this effort. ... Initiated the Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant Project. ... Complete the Qiaotou Reclaimed Water Plant in Kaohsiung, and it is estimated to supply 25 thousand m3 of water a day."
