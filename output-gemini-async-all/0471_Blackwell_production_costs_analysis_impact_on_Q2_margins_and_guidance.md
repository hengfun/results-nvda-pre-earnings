## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to release its Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into the material, non-consensus information surrounding its Blackwell production costs, margins, and forward-looking guidance reveals a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges. While demand for Blackwell GPUs remains robust, potential production bottlenecks, specific pricing strategies for the China market, and varying gross margin expectations are key areas that could significantly impact the upcoming report.

A notable contradiction exists regarding the pace of Blackwell's production ramp. Some reports indicate delays due to technical issues and supply chain constraints, while others project a rapid increase in shipment volumes. This divergence suggests that the market may not have a unified view on the immediate availability and cost structure of Blackwell, making the earnings call crucial for clarity.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Blackwell Production Delays and Hyperscaler Order Cuts:** Production delays for the Blackwell GPU, initially expected in mid-2025, have reportedly pushed shipments to late 2025. These delays are attributed to "overheating issues" and constrained CoWoS packaging capacity at TSMC. Consequently, hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon have reportedly cut orders, which could impact NVIDIA's Q3 revenue guidance of $32.5 billion.
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-26
    *   **Source:** AInvest,
    *   **Impact:** High. Specific technical challenges (overheating), direct impact on major customers (hyperscalers cutting orders), and a potential hit to future guidance are highly material and likely non-consensus.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While TSMC CoWoS capacity is a known bottleneck, the specific "overheating issues" and confirmed "hyperscalers cutting orders" are granular details that may not be fully priced into market expectations, especially given other reports suggesting a strong ramp.

*   **China-Specific Blackwell Pricing and Margin Impact:** To counteract a 15% revenue-sharing mandate in China, NVIDIA reportedly plans to increase prices on its China-specific Blackwell chips by 18%. While this strategy aims to protect profits, it is projected to slightly reduce gross margins for these specific chips from 71% to 69.3%.
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-26
    *   **Source:** MarketPulse,
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High. This reveals a specific pricing adjustment and its direct, quantified impact on margins for a significant market segment, offering a more detailed view than general discussions of China export controls.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The broader impact of China export restrictions is known, but the precise 18% price increase and the resulting 69.3% gross margin for China-specific Blackwell chips are likely non-consensus details.

*   **Gross Margin Sensitivity to Blackwell Ramp Costs and HBM:** Current gross margins are anticipated to be around 71–72%. However, the ramp-up costs associated with Blackwell, the expense of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), and the new U.S. licensing fee on China sales pose risks. A decline in gross margins below 70.5% would be a significant concern for investors, whereas maintaining stability near 72% would demonstrate NVIDIA's ability to scale production profitably.
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-27
    *   **Source:** Investing.com,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This highlights specific cost drivers impacting margins and provides a critical threshold (70.5%) that could trigger investor alarm, offering a more precise risk assessment.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The general pressures from new product ramps and HBM costs are understood, but the specific 70.5% "alarm" level for gross margins is a more precise, potentially non-consensus, indicator.

*   **FY2026 Gross Margin Projection Amid Manufacturing Costs:** The costs associated with scaling Blackwell manufacturing are expected to pressure gross margins, leading to a projected decline to 74.1% for the full fiscal year 2026. This temporary margin compression is noted as a factor investors should consider alongside the long-term potential of AI-driven demand.
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-23
    *   **Source:** AInvest,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Provides a specific, forward-looking gross margin projection for FY2026 directly linked to Blackwell manufacturing costs, offering a quantitative outlook on profitability.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. While the general concept of margin pressure during new product ramps is understood, the specific 74.1% FY2026 gross margin projection is a detailed analyst estimate that may not be universally adopted.

*   **Specific Blackwell Shipment Volume Projections:** Contrary to reports of delays, an analyst at Nomad Semi, Moore Morris, projects a strong ramp-up in Blackwell volumes. According to Morris, Blackwell shipments reached 750,000 units in Q1 2025, are expected to hit 1.2 million in Q2, and are projected to further increase to 1.5 million and 1.6 million in Q3 and Q4 2025, respectively.
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-22
    *   **Source:** Seeking Alpha,
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High. These specific, granular volume projections for current and upcoming quarters provide a detailed, potentially non-consensus, view of the Blackwell ramp, directly contradicting some delay narratives.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Contradictory. These specific volume numbers are likely non-consensus and directly conflict with the "production delays" and "hyperscalers cutting orders" mentioned in other recent articles, creating a significant point of contention for the earnings report.

*   **TSMC CoWoS-L Capacity Allocation and Shipment Growth:** NVIDIA has secured over 70% of TSMC's CoWoS-L advanced packaging capacity for 2025 due to strong demand for its Blackwell architecture GPUs. Total annual shipments are projected to exceed 2 million units, with quarterly volumes expected to increase by more than 20%.
    *   **Date:** 2025-02-24
    *   **Source:** TechPowerUp,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This provides crucial supply chain intelligence regarding NVIDIA's dominant position in securing critical packaging capacity and offers a quantitative outlook on potential shipment growth.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The importance of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is widely recognized, but the specific 70% allocation to NVIDIA and the 2 million unit annual shipment projection are detailed supply chain insights that may not be fully integrated into all market models.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Blackwell Production Ramp:** A significant contradiction exists between reports of Blackwell production delays due to "overheating issues" and TSMC CoWoS capacity constraints leading to hyperscaler order cuts, and analyst projections indicating a rapid and substantial ramp-up in Blackwell shipment volumes throughout 2025. The earnings report will be critical in clarifying the actual state of Blackwell production and its impact on current and future guidance.
*   **Gross Margin Outlook:** While NVIDIA's official guidance for Q2 FY2026 gross margins is around 71.8%-72.0%, specific factors like the China-specific pricing adjustments potentially lowering margins to 69.3% and the general pressures from expedited manufacturing suggest potential downside. Conversely, a longer-term FY2026 projection of 74.1% indicates an eventual recovery. The actual Q2 gross margin will reveal the immediate impact of these various forces.
*   **CoWoS Capacity Impact:** Despite NVIDIA securing a large portion of TSMC's CoWoS-L capacity, the mention of "constrained CoWoS packaging capacity" as a reason for Blackwell delays suggests that even with priority, this remains a significant bottleneck that could limit NVIDIA's ability to fully meet demand and impact its cost structure.
