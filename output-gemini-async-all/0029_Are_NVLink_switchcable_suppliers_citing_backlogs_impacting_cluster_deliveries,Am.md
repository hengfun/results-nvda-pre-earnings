## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have focused on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding NVLink switch/cable suppliers and their potential impact on cluster deliveries for NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance. My research prioritized recent supply chain reports, niche publications, and partner disclosures.

The key findings indicate a nuanced situation: while some NVLink component supply appears stable, there are significant discrepancies between NVIDIA's internal forecasts to suppliers and actual rack projections, alongside persistent deployment challenges at the customer level and long lead times for complete systems.

Here are the extracted findings:

---

**Finding 1: Discrepancy in NVIDIA's Internal Forecasts vs. Actual Rack Projections**

*   **Snippet:** "CY25 racks still projected at 25-30K, contingent on further progress and smooth GB300 transition. Firm orders to component suppliers noted lagging Nvidia's forecasts of 50-55K rack."
*   **Date:** June 23, 2025
*   **Source:** Interconnect, Passives and Electromechanical Components Market Insights, (URL not provided in snippet)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a significant non-consensus data point. NVIDIA's internal forecasts to component suppliers are nearly double the actual projected rack deployments for CY25. This suggests either an overly optimistic internal forecast by NVIDIA or substantial bottlenecks in customer deployment and integration, leading to a potential oversupply of certain components or slower revenue recognition than anticipated based on component shipments. This could directly impact revenue and guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Mainstream reports often focus on NVIDIA's high demand and pre-sold capacity, but this snippet reveals a potential disconnect between component supply and actual system deployment/firm orders.

**Finding 2: Customer Deployment and Performance Issues with NVLink Clusters**

*   **Snippet:** "Builds are improving, but CSPs are still dealing with deployment and performance issues, and Nvidia is still making changes."
*   **Date:** June 23, 2025
*   **Source:** Interconnect, Passives and Electromechanical Components Market Insights, (URL not provided in snippet)
*   **Impact:** Medium. Even if NVLink components are readily available, customer-side deployment and performance issues can delay the full operationalization of AI clusters, thereby impacting NVIDIA's ability to recognize revenue or leading to slower-than-expected ramp-ups for new systems. This indicates a potential bottleneck beyond component supply.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general AI infrastructure challenges are known, specific mentions of CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) dealing with "deployment and performance issues" directly impacting NVIDIA's builds are less common in public discourse.

**Finding 3: TE Connectivity as Sole Source for NVLink Backplane Cables with Shifting Connector Share**

*   **Snippet:** "TE still sole-sourced for backplane cables, but as anticipated, ceding some connector share in 2H tied to AWS supply chain de-risking."
*   **Date:** June 23, 2025
*   **Source:** Interconnect, Passives and Electromechanical Components Market Insights, (URL not provided in snippet)
*   **Impact:** Medium. TE Connectivity being a sole source for NVLink backplane *cables* presents a single point of failure risk for a critical component. While Amphenol is currently shipping 100% of NVL backplanes, the cable aspect remains concentrated. The ceding of connector share to de-risk the AWS supply chain indicates a broader industry effort to diversify, but the sole-source status for cables is a potential vulnerability.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific breakdown of sole-source status for cables versus diversified connector supply is granular and not widely reported.

**Finding 4: Long Lead Times for H100-Class Systems Persist**

*   **Snippet:** "Even with Nvidia shipping H100s at a record pace, typical delivery windows have only just eased from nearly a year to 8-12 weeks, keeping many projects in holding patterns while queue-hopping cloud platforms charge premium rates for priority access. ... server OEMs still quote about 39 weeks for H100-class systems; a full campus build routinely stretches to 12 months."
*   **Date:** July 14, 2025
*   **Source:** CUDO Compute, (URL not provided in snippet)
*   **Impact:** High. While the lead times for H100 GPUs themselves have improved, the significantly longer lead times for complete H100-class *systems* (39 weeks from OEMs, 12 months for full campus builds) indicate that the overall deployment of NVLink-enabled infrastructure remains heavily constrained. This suggests that even if NVLink components are available, the integration into full systems and data centers is a major bottleneck, potentially limiting NVIDIA's recognized revenue from complete solutions.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known, but the specific OEM lead times of "39 weeks" and "12 months for a full campus build" are more granular and less frequently highlighted than the general "months-long lead times" for GPUs.

**Finding 5: Next-Generation NVLink (Trn3) MP Delayed to 2H26 Due to SerDes Issues**

*   **Snippet:** "Trn3 reads noisy, with MP delayed to 2H26 amid SerDes issues prompting dual sourcing and second tape-outs from Alchip/MRVL."
*   **Date:** June 23, 2025
*   **Source:** Interconnect, Passives and Electromechanical Components Market Insights, (URL not provided in snippet)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While this does not directly affect Q2 FY26 earnings, it is material for forward-looking guidance. A delay in the next generation (Trn3, likely related to Rubin or future architectures) due to SerDes issues could impact NVIDIA's long-term product roadmap and competitive positioning. This could be a point of discussion in the earnings call regarding future product transitions.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Details about specific delays in future NVLink generations due to SerDes issues are highly technical and generally not public knowledge.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report for Q2 FY2026 will likely be influenced by a complex interplay of strong demand and persistent, albeit shifting, supply chain and deployment challenges. While the company's cutting-edge GPUs remain in high demand with pre-sold production runs and improving individual GPU delivery times, the broader picture for NVLink-enabled AI cluster deployments reveals several potential headwinds.

A significant non-consensus finding is the notable discrepancy between NVIDIA's internal component supplier forecasts (50-55K racks for CY25) and the more conservative actual rack projections (25-30K for CY25). This suggests that either NVIDIA is over-forecasting demand to its suppliers, or more likely, there are substantial bottlenecks in the actual deployment and integration of these complex AI systems by customers, particularly Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who are reportedly "dealing with deployment and performance issues." These customer-side challenges could slow down the rate at which NVIDIA can recognize revenue, even if components are being shipped.

Furthermore, while Amphenol appears to be meeting current demand for NVLink backplanes, TE Connectivity remains a sole source for NVLink backplane *cables*, introducing a potential single point of failure. The fact that TE is ceding some connector share for AWS de-risking highlights the industry's awareness of supply chain concentration, but the cable aspect remains a concern.

Looking ahead, the next generation of NVLink (Trn3) is reportedly facing delays in its mass production until 2H26 due to SerDes issues, which could impact NVIDIA's future product roadmap and guidance, even if it doesn't affect the immediate quarter.

Finally, while individual GPU lead times have improved, the overall system-level bottlenecks persist. Server OEMs are still quoting lengthy lead times (around 39 weeks) for H100-class systems, and full data center campus builds can stretch to a year. This indicates that the availability of NVLink components is only one piece of a larger, complex puzzle, and the ability to rapidly scale AI infrastructure remains constrained by broader system integration and deployment challenges. Investors should pay close attention to management's commentary on customer deployment rates, system-level lead times, and any updates on the Trn3 roadmap.
