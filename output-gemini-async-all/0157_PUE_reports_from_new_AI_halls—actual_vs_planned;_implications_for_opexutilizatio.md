## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) reports from new AI data halls, actual versus planned PUE, and their implications for operational expenses (opex) and utilization has been extracted from recent web content (published within the last 3 months). This information is likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The rapid proliferation of AI workloads, largely powered by NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs, is creating significant strain and complexity within data center infrastructure. While NVIDIA's H100 GPUs offer substantial performance-per-watt improvements over previous generations, their absolute power draw (up to 700W) and the even higher demands of upcoming SKUs (exceeding 1,500W) are pushing existing data center capabilities to their limits.

A key finding is the stagnation of average PUE levels for the sixth consecutive year, primarily due to constraints from legacy infrastructure. This means that many data centers are struggling to efficiently cool and power the high-density racks required for modern AI, leading to higher operational costs than anticipated. Even in new facilities, operational PUE often falls short of design targets, especially during ramp-up periods or in multi-tenant environments, further exacerbating opex.

Furthermore, NVIDIA's own analysis reportedly indicates that certain "bridge" liquid cooling solutions, such as liquid-to-air (L2A), are proving to be the most expensive cooling path due to both capital and operational inefficiencies. This suggests that customers adopting these interim solutions might face higher-than-expected opex, potentially impacting their budget allocation for future GPU purchases or their ability to scale deployments.

The industry is also grappling with significant delays (18-24 months) and cost overruns (25% or more) in data center construction, which directly impedes the timely deployment and utilization of NVIDIA's advanced hardware. This, coupled with a general apprehension among operators regarding the immense power demands of projected NVIDIA GPU systems, is contributing to capacity concerns and could lead to slower adoption rates or more cautious purchasing decisions, potentially affecting NVIDIA's revenue recognition and future guidance. The mandatory shift towards direct-to-chip liquid cooling for next-generation systems like NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72 underscores the fundamental architectural changes and associated costs that customers must undertake.

**Structured Findings:**

---

-   **Snippet:** "Average PUE levels show little change for the sixth consecutive year, with improvements constrained by legacy infrastructure and some climate specific limitations to efficient cooling. Average server rack power densities continue to rise, with greater adoption of racks in the 10–30 kW range. Few facilities exceed 30 kW, and extreme densities are as yet rare."
-   **Date:** July 30, 2025
-   **Source:** Uptime's 15th Annual Global Data Center Survey Results, Uptime Institute
-   **Impact:** High. This indicates that a significant portion of existing data center infrastructure is not keeping pace with the power and cooling demands of NVIDIA's high-density AI GPUs (H100s often push beyond 30kW per rack). Stagnant PUE implies higher operational costs for customers deploying NVIDIA hardware in these facilities, or a slower transition to new, more efficient builds, potentially impacting NVIDIA's sales cycle and customers' ability to fully utilize purchased hardware.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While increasing power density is known, the *stagnation* of average PUE despite technological advancements suggests a systemic challenge in operational efficiency that might not be fully priced into consensus expectations for AI infrastructure build-out.

-   **Snippet:** "Chips like Nvidia's H100 already reach 700W thermal design power (TDP); upcoming SKUs exceed 1,500W. The problem is not just about power; it's also about geometry and thermodynamic efficiency. That's why Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 system – the AI infrastructure standard bearer – is designed explicitly for direct-to-chip (DTC) liquid cooling."

-   **Source:** Data Centers are Becoming Burning Platforms Requiring New Ways of Cooling - EE Times
-   **Impact:** High. This highlights the escalating power demands of NVIDIA's current and future products, necessitating a fundamental shift to advanced cooling solutions like direct-to-chip liquid cooling. This implies significant CapEx and OpEx for customers, potentially slowing down deployment timelines or increasing the total cost of ownership for NVIDIA's hardware.
-   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the explicit mention of "upcoming SKUs exceed 1,500W" and NVIDIA's GB200 being "designed explicitly for direct-to-chip liquid cooling" reinforces the urgency and scale of the infrastructure challenge, which might be underestimated in terms of immediate financial impact on customers.

---

-   **Snippet:** "Nvidia's own TCO analysis shows that L2A solutions are the most expensive cooling path available, due to both capital cost and operational inefficiency. The cooling and power demands of current and next-generation systems are forcing the industry to rethink facility designs from the ground up."
-   **Date:** August 13, 2025
-   **Source:** Data Centers are Becoming Burning Platforms Requiring New Ways of Cooling - EE Times
-   **Impact:** High. This is a critical non-consensus point. If NVIDIA's internal analysis identifies certain cooling solutions as highly inefficient and costly, it suggests that customers who have adopted or are considering these "bridge" solutions might face higher-than-expected operational expenses. This could lead to re-evaluation of deployment strategies, impacting future GPU orders or the profitability of AI services built on these infrastructures.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the general cost of cooling is known, NVIDIA's *own* TCO analysis identifying specific solutions as "most expensive" and "operationally inefficient" is a strong signal that may not be widely understood or factored into customer budgeting and, by extension, NVIDIA's near-term demand.

-   **Snippet:** "With a trillion-dollar capital investment forecast, delays in data center construction (averaging 18-24 months) frequently cause cost overruns of 25% or more. Without precise planning tools, this can spiral into inefficiencies and stranded investments."
-   **Date:** June 19, 2025
-   **Source:** Smarter Data Center Capacity Planning for AI Innovation - Hyperview
-   **Impact:** High. Delays and cost overruns in building AI-ready data centers directly affect the speed at which NVIDIA's customers can deploy and utilize their purchased GPUs. This could lead to slower revenue recognition for NVIDIA, deferred demand, or lower utilization rates for already-shipped hardware, impacting forward guidance.
-   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific figures (18-24 month delays, 25%+ cost overruns) provide concrete data points that highlight the magnitude of the challenge, which could be underappreciated in its impact on NVIDIA's immediate sales pipeline and customer deployment schedules.

-   **Snippet:** "Uncertainty over the appropriate or likely venues for AI workloads, and apprehension over the power demands of projected NVIDIA GPU systems, is likely contributing to capacity concerns."
-   **Date:** July 30, 2025
-   **Source:** Uptime's 15th Annual Global Data Center Survey Results, Uptime Institute
-   **Impact:** High. This directly points to a potential bottleneck in demand realization for NVIDIA. If customers are apprehensive about the power demands of NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs, it could lead to more cautious purchasing decisions, slower ramp-ups, or a delay in committing to large-scale deployments, directly affecting NVIDIA's sales and guidance.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the general challenge of AI power is known, the explicit mention of "apprehension over the power demands of projected NVIDIA GPU systems" from a reputable industry survey suggests a specific customer sentiment that could be a non-consensus factor impacting NVIDIA's near-term outlook.

-   **Snippet:** "But few data centres operate at those levels consistently in real-world situations. Newly built data centres often experience ramp-up periods, where server halls are not yet fully leased. Retail colocation facilities, in particular, face regular churn and vacancy. These business realities mean operational PUE is typically less efficient than the design target."

-   **Source:** Beyond the Metric: How PUE is Redefining Data Centre Competitiveness | DC Byte
-   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates that even in new, purpose-built AI data centers, actual operational efficiency (and thus opex) might be worse than initially planned, especially during the initial phases of deployment or in multi-tenant environments. This could lead to higher operational costs for NVIDIA's customers than initially modeled, potentially impacting their overall budget for AI infrastructure.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The distinction between "design PUE" and "operational PUE" and the reasons for the latter being less efficient are often not highlighted in general market commentary, making this a non-consensus detail that could impact customer profitability and future investment decisions.
