## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into recent developments, particularly concerning Microsoft's AI capital expenditure plans, reveals several material insights. While the overarching narrative remains one of robust demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, some nuanced and potentially non-consensus information could influence investor sentiment and forward-looking guidance.

A key takeaway is Microsoft's aggressive capital expenditure, signaling continued strong demand for AI infrastructure, including NVIDIA's GPUs. However, earlier concerns about delays in NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell platform appear to have been addressed, with the company confirming full-scale production. Conversely, a recent analyst note from Goldman Sachs suggests potential near-term headwinds for NVIDIA, offering a more cautious perspective amidst the prevailing bullish sentiment.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: Microsoft's Aggressive AI Capex Plans for Q2 FY26**

*   **Snippet:** "Microsoft plans to spend $30 billion in capital expenditures next quarter alone — a $120 billion annual run rate — to expand its AI infrastructure footprint (by funding more data centers, more GPUs, and more power-hungry cloud capacity to support its growing customer base)."
*   **Date:** July 31, 2025
*   **Source:** Quartz, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEiFH7nakKzPy77OyDNExvX7CkH7TEyorP55qjhEK6Cr7DITk8hv1Hzx5B1NZnygkB7uN2nKue5dJ0Z1j55qQi2osx4WpyLOOmw9i0FEKK8Ep-uy_iEkfip2Kc0wUqaxWvLNK5q_3kbl07E9duFxCSw0kPcoOnN0C21omxq](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEiFH7nakKzPy77OyDNExvX7CkH7TEyorP55qjhEK6Cr7DITk8hv1Hzx5B1NZnygkB7uN2nKue5dJ0Z1j55qQi2osx4WpyLOOmw9i0FEKK8Ep-uy_iEkfip2Kc0wUqaxWvLNK5q_3kbl07E9duFxCSw0kPcoOnN0C21omxq)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a substantial and specific capital expenditure commitment from a major hyperscaler, directly indicating robust demand for GPUs. Microsoft's "next quarter" refers to its Q2 FY26 (ending September 30, 2025), which directly impacts NVIDIA's Q2 FY26 earnings and Q3 FY26 guidance. The sheer scale of this spending suggests a strong underlying demand for NVIDIA's products.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that hyperscalers are spending heavily on AI, but the specific $30 billion for Microsoft's *next quarter alone* is a concrete data point that reinforces the magnitude of this spending. It might be overlooked in terms of its direct, immediate impact on NVIDIA's upcoming guidance.

**Finding 2: Blackwell NVL72 AI Supercomputer in Full-Scale Production**

*   **Snippet:** "Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer — a 'thinking machine' designed for reasoning— is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4LMbJ3Djziy8LbPjSLEnxZ2pZ4NVJqRti4eWfTjp8sPX4O_gdFi9AuZ35JniiwSgHXVD4WWeJinrCpK7pxtc3FbUJ1TQ1OspWqU0opye9rKk1KEgDvWvNYfHKxLF8e_gUo2c20_NC4UE6ScjS7CCsK_nSRFeQrebCj1azyshLQLm_riSuyjftn-ECg3kYg24TYj7wAFoAyWpHOUTasg==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4LMbJ3Djziy8LbPjSLEnxZ2pZ4NVJqRti4eWfTjp8sPX4O_gdFi9AuZ35JniiwSgHXVD4WWeJinrCpK7pxtc3FbUJ1TQ1OspWqU0opye9rKk1KEgDvVvNYfHKxLF8e_gUo2c20_NC4UE6ScjS7CCsK_nSRFeQrebCj1azyshLQLm_riSuyjftn-ECg3kYg24TYj7wAFoAyWpHOUTasg==)
*   **Impact:** High. This directly addresses and contradicts earlier reports from January 2025 that suggested NVIDIA's top customers, including Microsoft, were delaying orders of Blackwell racks due to overheating issues and glitches. The confirmation of "full-scale production" indicates these issues have either been resolved or were not as widespread as initially reported, removing a potential overhang on NVIDIA's future revenue.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is likely non-consensus if the market is still factoring in the older reports of Blackwell delays. NVIDIA's official statement of full-scale production should alleviate these concerns, potentially leading to a positive re-evaluation of future growth.

**Finding 3: Goldman Sachs' Cautious Near-Term Outlook for NVIDIA**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) shares may face near-term headwinds even as Goldman Sachs remains optimistic about the company's long-term growth. The firm's analysts said they remain 'very bullish on Nvidia's prospects for driving outsized growth in 2026,' but warned the stock could struggle in the coming months."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025

*   **Impact:** Medium. While Goldman Sachs remains bullish long-term, their warning about "near-term headwinds" and potential struggles in the coming months, particularly due to "uncertainty on the direction of travel in 2027," presents a more cautious, potentially non-consensus view. This could temper some of the extreme bullishness surrounding NVIDIA's immediate performance and guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is a non-consensus view against the backdrop of generally very positive analyst sentiment for NVIDIA. It highlights a potential point of caution that might be overlooked by the broader market.

**Finding 4: NVIDIA's Q2 FY26 Guidance Reflects $8.0 Billion H20 Revenue Loss**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4LMbJ3Djziy8LbPjSLEnxZ2pZ4NVJqRti4eWfTjp8sPX4O_gdFi9AuZ35JniiwSgHXVD4WWeJinrCpK7pxtc3FbUJ1TQ1OspWqU0opye9rKk1KEgDvVvNYfHKxLF8e_gUo2c20_NC4UE6ScjS7CCsK_nSRFeQrebCj1azyshLQLm_riSuyjftn-ECg3kYg24TYj7wAFoAyWpHOUTasg==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4LMbJ3Djziy8LbPjSLEnxZ2pZ4NVJqRti4eWfTjp8sPX4O_gdFi9AuZ35JniiwSgHXVD4WWeJinrCpK7pxtc3FbUJ1TQ1OspWqU0opye9rKk1KEgDvVvNYfHKxLF8e_gUo2c20_NC4UE6ScjS7CCsK_nSRFeQrebCj1azyshLQLm_riSuyjftn-ECg3kYg24TYj7wAFoAyWpHOUTasg==)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While this is from NVIDIA's own guidance and therefore "known," the specific magnitude of the revenue loss ($8.0 billion) due to export controls on H20 products for the China market is a material factor. It provides a concrete number for how geopolitical factors are impacting NVIDIA's top line, and analysts will be assessing if this impact is fully priced in or if there are further implications for future quarters.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is widely known as it was part of NVIDIA's previous earnings guidance. However, the specific impact on Q2 FY26 and potential for ongoing effects on Q3 guidance could be a point of focus for non-consensus analysis.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Blackwell Production:** A significant contradiction exists between the January 2025 report of Blackwell delays and overheating issues and NVIDIA's May 2025 announcement of "full-scale production" for the Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer. This suggests that any initial issues have been resolved, or the earlier reports were overstated. This resolution is a positive development for NVIDIA.
*   **Microsoft's Own Chips:** While older reports mentioned Microsoft installing its own Maia chips, more recent information still emphasizes Microsoft's massive capex for "more GPUs" (implying NVIDIA's). There's a gap in understanding the current balance between Microsoft's internal chip development and its reliance on NVIDIA for its AI infrastructure build-out. While Microsoft is likely diversifying, the sheer scale of its announced capex suggests continued significant demand for NVIDIA's offerings.
*   **Specific Microsoft Order Details:** While Microsoft's overall capex is high, specific details on *new* NVIDIA GPU orders from Microsoft for Q2 FY26 or Q3 FY26 guidance are not explicitly detailed in the recent search results. The information is more at a high-level capex commitment.

In conclusion, while the overall sentiment remains positive due to strong AI demand and Microsoft's substantial capex, the resolution of Blackwell production issues is a key positive, potentially overlooked by those relying on older reports. However, Goldman Sachs' cautious near-term outlook and the ongoing impact of H20 export controls present areas for careful consideration in NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and guidance.
