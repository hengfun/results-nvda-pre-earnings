## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective is to identify material, non-consensus information regarding major customer wins for AMD or Intel in the AI accelerator market that could impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The research focuses on web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025).

While Intel has made announcements regarding the expanded availability of its Gaudi 3 accelerators through channels like Dell AI Factory and new PCIe card variants (May 19-20, 2025), these reports fall just outside the strict three-month publication window. Furthermore, specific, large-scale customer deployment wins with quantifiable impact for Intel's AI accelerators within the recent three-month period were not prominently found. The significant IBM Cloud adoption of Gaudi 3, while impactful, was reported in late August/early September 2024, also outside the specified timeframe.

In contrast, recent reports highlight significant traction and specific customer wins for AMD's Instinct AI accelerators, indicating a growing competitive threat to NVIDIA's dominant market position. This information is material as it points to potential market share shifts and increased competition, which could influence NVIDIA's future revenue and guidance.

Here are the key findings regarding AMD's recent customer wins and competitive positioning:

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The pre-earnings research for NVIDIA reveals a notable increase in competitive activity and customer adoption for AMD's AI accelerators within the last three months. This suggests that while NVIDIA maintains a dominant market share, AMD is making significant inroads, particularly among hyperscalers and major AI model builders.

Key findings indicate that AMD's Instinct MI300X and the newer MI350/MI355X series are gaining traction. Oracle is deploying a massive 27,000-node AI cluster utilizing MI355X accelerators, claiming up to 40% more tokens per dollar in inference compared to competitors. This specific, large-scale deployment with a quantifiable cost-performance advantage is a direct challenge to NVIDIA's value proposition. Furthermore, AMD has secured a multibillion-dollar sovereign AI deal with HUMAIN in Saudi Arabia, signaling long-term revenue potential in a critical strategic market.

In the cloud and enterprise space, Microsoft Azure is now powering both proprietary and open-source models in production with MI300X, and Cohere is deploying its scalable Command models on MI300X for enterprise-grade LLM inference. An expanded collaboration with Red Hat also aims to enable production-ready AI environments with AMD Instinct GPUs. AMD's claim that seven of the top ten AI model builders are now using Instinct products underscores a growing acceptance within the core AI development community, which has historically been a stronghold for NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem.

Perhaps most indicative of a shifting landscape is the recent upgrade of AMD's stock by Truist Securities, based on industry feedback suggesting that hyperscale clients are increasingly viewing AMD as a genuine long-term partner rather than merely a "price check" against NVIDIA. Additionally, Meta is deploying MI300X for Llama 3 and 4 inference, and critically, OpenAI is collaborating with AMD on next-generation GPU design. This collaboration with OpenAI, a key NVIDIA partner, could signal a strategic diversification in the AI builder community's hardware choices. The MI355X accelerators, which started shipping to customers in late June, are now actively competing in the market.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

While AMD's momentum is evident, NVIDIA still holds a significant market share (estimated 80-90%). The scale of these AMD wins, while substantial, needs to be contextualized against NVIDIA's overall market size and ongoing demand. The long-term impact of these wins on NVIDIA's market share and revenue will depend on the continued execution by AMD and the stickiness of NVIDIA's CUDA software ecosystem. Intel's recent announcements focused more on product availability and channel expansion rather than specific, large-scale customer wins within the strict three-month window, suggesting AMD is currently posing a more direct and immediate competitive threat in terms of new customer acquisition. The impact of US export controls to China and NVIDIA's recent deal to resume sales there also remains a complex factor influencing the overall market.
