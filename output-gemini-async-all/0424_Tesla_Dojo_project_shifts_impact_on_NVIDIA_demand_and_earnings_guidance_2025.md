## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the material, non-consensus information regarding Tesla's Dojo project shifts and their likely impact on NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Recent developments indicate a significant strategic pivot by Tesla concerning its in-house AI supercomputer project, Dojo. Multiple reports from early August 2025 confirm that Tesla is reportedly dismantling its Dojo program and will instead deepen its reliance on external AI hardware providers, specifically NVIDIA and AMD. This decision, reportedly ordered by Elon Musk, marks a reversal from earlier statements made during Tesla's Q2 2025 earnings call in late July, where there were mentions of Dojo 2 scaling in 2026 and future chips integrating Dojo technology.

This rapid shift is highly material for NVIDIA. The abandonment of a costly and complex in-house chip development program by a major technology player like Tesla is a strong validation of NVIDIA's leadership in AI hardware. It suggests that Tesla will increase its orders for NVIDIA's general-purpose GPUs (such as H100 and H200 units) to power its AI training for autonomous driving, robotaxi services, and the Optimus humanoid robot. While Tesla is also expected to increase reliance on AMD and partner with Samsung for its AI6 inference chips, the immediate and near-term impact on NVIDIA's data center GPU demand is likely to be positive.

The timing of this news, emerging just weeks after Tesla's Q2 earnings call and days before NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report (due today, August 27, 2025), suggests that the full implications might not be entirely priced into all analyst models. While some analysts, like Wells Fargo, have already highlighted this as a positive for NVIDIA, the specific magnitude and timeline of increased NVIDIA orders from Tesla could still represent a non-consensus upside surprise for NVIDIA's guidance. The challenges faced by Tesla in developing its own wafer-scale processors, including memory limitations and production complexity, underscore the difficulty of competing with established leaders like NVIDIA.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1:**
- **Snippet:** "Tesla scraps custom Dojo wafer-level processor initiative, dismantles team — Musk to lean on Nvidia and AMD more. ... Today, this reportedly comes to an end as Tesla has decided to dismantle its Dojo supercomputer program, reassign its remaining staff to other computing projects, and turn more heavily to outside technology providers like AMD or Nvidia, according to Bloomberg. Tesla has not formally confirmed the Dojo shutdown. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, has recently ordered the Dojo effort to be entirely wound down, according to the report."

- **Impact:** High. This provides specific analyst commentary (Wells Fargo) and concrete data points on Tesla's existing and planned NVIDIA GPU deployments (50,000 H100, 16,000 H200). The disbandment of Dojo suggests these numbers could increase further.
- **Consensus Check:** Analyst view, but the specific quantities and the *implication* of further increases due to Dojo's shutdown might not be fully modeled by all.

---

**Finding 4:**
- **Snippet:** "Musk referenced Dojo, albeit briefly, during Tesla's Q2 earnings call, where he also hinted at internal redundancies. According to Bloomberg, Tesla now plans to deepen its reliance on external partners like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) for compute power, and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) for chip manufacturing. Last month, Tesla signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to produce its upcoming AI6 inference chips, which are designed to scale across Tesla's FSD platform, the Optimus humanoid robot, and high-performance AI data center workloads."
- **Date:** 2025-08-08
- **Source:** Seeking Alpha, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEz-V2vhrqxOVTNRlwCBINUBCHjJkDUq85z_heM310EE1OwKItRIKDBMtWd5SPHl7McOd4RuTnQQG9Y41UiXc0_BpWbiwLd0LbGXRh4_gpItHA6m0s_mjBKo7myetEODJgZ9sTQt0uB3f5UYCUg_PlSV0HrsLkSTHIWCPTXIPrdHXp5J3C2gBcId74sx33DFhqD-t2qSpS_aNKbygi1hcg=]
- **Impact:** Medium. While Tesla is partnering with Samsung for AI6 inference chips, the "deepen its reliance on external partners like Nvidia and AMD for compute power" part is key for NVIDIA. The AI6 is for inference, but training still heavily relies on GPUs like NVIDIA's.
- **Consensus Check:** This detail about AI6 and Samsung is known, but the distinction between inference (AI6) and training (NVIDIA GPUs) and the resulting increased demand for NVIDIA's training GPUs might be a nuanced, non-consensus point.

---

**Finding 5:**
- **Snippet:** "The reports mark “very different” messaging from Musk's late-July comments during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call. Wells Fargo explained that at the time, he said Dojo 2 would operate at scale in 2026, equivalent to 100,000 NVIDIA H100 chips, and suggested Dojo 3 and the Ai6 inference chip would converge into the same design."
- **Date:** 2025-08-08
- **Source:** Investing.com, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHzRN_43MuV2WCmg7mi4UEp4ZrHWHm95MYm2ilcFItbmA_VvGD78WI0wbcVxUiH2Tvioh4hAgKW7Q0xshHeSC7bFYmpNQsgGDh6VvWYh2o9jH_HNHyPQ9FBFB4jv7UCwKYFwHJsya9kANaavEcoWR_X3RRSJClaXrNS56LBiNG59n9DqyqDJvB07SKPuCxPp-fdmYTxBFOz2bL60s80kuM7lmVw0P4zESYxGw2ZVJRfTq3bYEqVBuoRaziVILIzr_SuPdY=]
- **Impact:** High. This highlights a significant and rapid change in Tesla's strategy *after* their Q2 earnings call. This rapid reversal makes the August news highly non-consensus, as analysts would have been working with the July statements. The previous target of 100,000 H100 equivalent for Dojo 2 now likely translates to a higher demand for actual NVIDIA H100/H200 GPUs.
- **Consensus Check:** Highly non-consensus due to the rapid shift in strategy post-Tesla's Q2 earnings call. This could lead to a positive surprise in NVIDIA's guidance.

---

**Finding 6:**
- **Snippet:** "The decision to shut down Dojo reflects Tesla's broader strategy to consolidate its AI efforts and reduce the complexity of its infrastructure. The new focus is on AI6, a next-generation chip designed to handle both AI training and real-time inference. Musk believes that AI6 will be more efficient and scalable than the specialized chips used in the Dojo project. The AI6 chip is expected to power Tesla's self-driving vehicles and support its Optimus humanoid robot ambitions. Tesla has partnered with Samsung to produce AI6 chips, with a reported deal worth $16.5 billion."
- **Date:** 2025-08-14

- **Impact:** Medium. While AI6 is intended for both training and inference, the immediate need for high-performance training will likely still fall to NVIDIA's GPUs, especially given the stated efficiency and scalability benefits of AI6 are still in development. The $16.5 billion deal with Samsung is significant but for a future chip.
- **Consensus Check:** The AI6 development and Samsung partnership are known, but the implication that NVIDIA will fill the immediate training gap more extensively due to Dojo's demise might be a non-consensus interpretation.
