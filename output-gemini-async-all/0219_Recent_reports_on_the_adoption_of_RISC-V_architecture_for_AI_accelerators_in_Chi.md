## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, I have identified several material and potentially non-consensus pieces of information regarding the adoption of RISC-V architecture for AI accelerators in China, which are likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The information gathered is primarily from the last three months, with one key forward-looking analyst prediction from late 2024.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is facing a complex and increasingly challenging landscape in China, largely driven by ongoing US export controls and China's aggressive push for technological self-sufficiency, particularly in AI. Recent developments indicate a significant acceleration in China's domestic AI chip capabilities and the strategic adoption of RISC-V architecture as a key enabler.

A major blow to NVIDIA's immediate performance is the recent halt in H20 AI chip production due to Chinese regulatory scrutiny, resulting in a substantial $4.5 billion inventory writedown. This directly impacts NVIDIA's financials and underscores the volatile nature of the Chinese market under current geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has openly warned that US export restrictions are proving counterproductive, inadvertently strengthening Chinese AI rivals like Huawei and potentially costing NVIDIA up to $8 billion in sales this quarter alone. This suggests that the intended effect of the sanctions is being undermined, leading to market share erosion for NVIDIA.

In a strategic move, NVIDIA has announced support for RISC-V processors on its CUDA software platform. While this could be seen as an attempt to adapt and maintain influence within China's evolving ecosystem, it also legitimizes RISC-V and could inadvertently accelerate the development of a robust, open-source AI chip ecosystem in China that might eventually compete more directly with NVIDIA's proprietary hardware.

China's commitment to RISC-V is further solidified by the imminent release of formal, nationwide policy guidelines to promote its widespread adoption. This state-backed initiative will create a more structured and supportive environment for domestic RISC-V AI chip development, posing a long-term threat to foreign chip architectures. This is complemented by China's strategic focus on developing open-weight AI models, a move that could reduce reliance on cutting-edge, high-performance chips (like NVIDIA's) by fostering an ecosystem where more accessible, potentially RISC-V-based, domestic solutions can thrive.

While some smaller Chinese AI chip companies are reportedly struggling, established players like Huawei and Cambricon are showing significant gains. A Citigroup analyst even predicts a substantial decline in NVIDIA's market share in China, from over 80% in 2024 to 50-60% in 2025, with domestic firms being the primary beneficiaries. This suggests a bifurcated market where well-backed Chinese entities are effectively capitalizing on the void created by US sanctions.
