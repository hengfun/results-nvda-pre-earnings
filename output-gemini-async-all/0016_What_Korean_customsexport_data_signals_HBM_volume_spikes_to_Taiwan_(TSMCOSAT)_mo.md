## Analysis

As a pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply and demand has been extracted from recent web content, with a focus on Korean customs/export data to Taiwan. This information is likely to impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

***

### Analysis of Findings:

The data indicates a robust and accelerating supply of HBM from South Korea to Taiwan, which is a critical hub for NVIDIA's AI accelerator packaging (TSMC/OSAT). The significant year-over-year increases in semiconductor exports, particularly in memory chips, strongly suggest a healthy and growing HBM pipeline. This aligns with the broader narrative of surging AI demand, as evidenced by TSMC's record-breaking Q2 revenue and its CEO's comments on AI demand consistently outpacing supply.

A key non-consensus insight is Samsung's ongoing struggle with NVIDIA's HBM3E 12-high chip certification. This suggests that NVIDIA's HBM supply is heavily reliant on SK Hynix and potentially Micron, which could lead to a more concentrated and potentially more stable supply chain for NVIDIA, albeit with less diversified sourcing. While the overall HBM market is expanding rapidly, Samsung's delays could mean that the available HBM is being disproportionately directed towards NVIDIA's primary suppliers, thus benefiting NVIDIA's ability to meet demand.

The month-over-month data for Korean semiconductor exports to Taiwan, especially the record-breaking July figures, provides a strong signal of sustained and accelerating HBM volume. This granular data, particularly the specific dollar amounts and percentage increases, offers a more concrete picture than general market trends and points to strong underlying demand for NVIDIA's products.

### Structured Findings:

**1. Korean Semiconductor Exports to Taiwan (January-May 2025) Surge, Driven by HBM**

*   **Snippet:** "Korea exported $16.08 billion worth of goods to Taiwan from January to May this year, a 62.5 percent increase compared to the same period last year... Semiconductors remain Korea's top export to Taiwan. Shipments of memory chips reached $8.46 billion in the first five months, accounting for 52.6 percent of all Korean exports to Taiwan, up 192.9 percent from a year earlier. When including semiconductor manufacturing equipment, chip-related goods made up 72 percent of total exports. Industry analysts attribute much of the surge to SK hynix's exports of HBM chips. Taiwan-based TSMC packages SK hynix HBM chips into AI accelerators at facilities in Taiwan and supplies them to Nvidia in the United States."
*   **Date:** June 24, 2025
*   **Source:** Korea JoongAng Daily, [URL if available] (The provided URL is a grounding API redirect, so a direct public URL is not available in the snippet)
*   **Impact:** **High.** This provides concrete, recent data on a massive increase in memory chip exports from Korea to Taiwan, explicitly linking it to SK Hynix HBM for NVIDIA via TSMC. This indicates strong HBM supply flowing into NVIDIA's packaging pipeline for Q2 FY2026.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general trend of increasing HBM demand is known, but the specific magnitude (192.9% YoY for memory chips) and the direct attribution to SK Hynix's HBM for NVIDIA is a material, non-consensus data point that highlights the intensity of the supply.

**2. South Korea's Semiconductor Exports to Taiwan Hit Record High in July 2025**

*   **Snippet:** "South Korea experienced a sharp rise in exports to Taiwan, a key market for its semiconductor industry... Korea saw its semiconductor exports to Taiwan nearly double, soaring 68% to USD 4.66 billion. This marked the highest export figure ever recorded for the month of July, the report notes. ... The surge was driven by robust demand for AI-related technologies and a rush by companies to stock up on chips ahead of potential tariffs threatened by Donald Trump on imported semiconductors. ... Yonhap News highlights that the growth was driven by rising memory chip prices and steady demand for high-value products like HBM chips and DDR5."
*   **Date:** August 4, 2025
*   **Source:** TrendForce (citing Chosun Daily, MoneyDJ, Yonhap News, Reuters), [URL if available] (The provided URL is a grounding API redirect, so a direct public URL is not available in the snippet)
*   **Impact:** **High.** This snippet provides the most recent monthly data point, showing a near-doubling of semiconductor exports to Taiwan in July, explicitly mentioning HBM. This indicates continued and accelerating HBM supply into NVIDIA's ecosystem, directly impacting the current quarter's supply and potentially forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** While strong AI demand is consensus, the specific 68% YoY surge in semiconductor exports to Taiwan in July, reaching a record high, is a strong, recent, and potentially non-consensus indicator of the immediate HBM supply situation.

**3. Samsung's HBM3E Certification Delays with NVIDIA**

*   **Snippet:** "Analysts say Samsung's HBM3E 12-high chips have yet to receive Nvidia's certification, limiting its entry into the most lucrative segment of the AI supply chain. Although the company began supplying these chips to AMD in June, shipments to Nvidia are unlikely to scale meaningfully in 2024. It has already failed Nvidia's quality evaluations multiple times, and that's not a great sign."
*   **Date:** July 7, 2025
*   **Source:** SamMobile, [URL if available] (The provided URL is a grounding API redirect, so a direct public URL is not available in the snippet)
*   **Impact:** **High.** This is a critical non-consensus piece of information. If Samsung, a major HBM producer, is struggling with NVIDIA's certification, it implies that NVIDIA's HBM supply is primarily coming from SK Hynix and Micron. This could mean a more constrained but potentially more reliable supply from fewer vendors for NVIDIA, and highlights the competitive advantage of SK Hynix. It also suggests that any HBM supply issues for NVIDIA are less likely to be due to overall HBM production capacity and more about specific vendor qualification.
*   **Consensus Check:** This information about Samsung's specific certification issues with NVIDIA is likely non-consensus and highly material, as it directly impacts NVIDIA's supply chain diversification and reliance on its current HBM partners.

**4. TSMC's Record Q2 Revenue and AI Demand Outpacing Supply**

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC still delivered record quarterly revenue of NT$933.8 billion in Q2 2025, up 38.6% year-over-year... CEO C.C. Wei has stated that AI demand “consistently outpaces supply”."
*   **Date:** July 11, 2025
*   **Source:** Tech in Asia, [URL if available] (The provided URL is a grounding API redirect, so a direct public URL is not available in the snippet)
*   **Impact:** **Medium.** While TSMC's strong performance driven by AI is broadly known, the CEO's explicit statement that "AI demand consistently outpaces supply" is a strong confirmation of the underlying demand for the entire AI ecosystem, including NVIDIA's GPUs and the HBM that goes into them. This reinforces the positive outlook for NVIDIA's products.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general strength of AI demand is consensus, but the specific and recent statement from TSMC's CEO about demand *outpacing supply* provides a strong, current, and material confirmation that could be overlooked in its direct implications for NVIDIA's future orders and pricing power.
