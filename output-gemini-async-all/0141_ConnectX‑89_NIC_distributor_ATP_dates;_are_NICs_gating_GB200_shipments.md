## Analysis

Here's an analysis of NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings, focusing on material, non-consensus information regarding ConnectX-8/9 NICs and their potential impact on GB200 shipments.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's GB200 Superchip platform is a highly complex system, and its successful ramp-up is crucial for the company's future growth. While direct "Available-To-Promise" (ATP) dates for ConnectX-8/9 NICs from distributors are not readily available in recent reports, the broader narrative suggests that high-speed networking components, including ConnectX-8 SuperNICs, are integral to the GB200's architecture and have been part of the system-level integration challenges.

Initial delays in GB200 shipments were attributed to a range of technical issues, including "inter-chip connectivity problems" and "software bugs" that required significant supply chain collaboration earlier this year (around February-March 2025). These issues, while not solely NIC-specific, highlight the complexity of synchronizing a large number of processors and their interconnects, where NICs play a critical role. The GB200's demanding specifications for "high-speed interconnect interfaces" have necessitated "additional time for optimization and adjustment" in the supply chain.

ConnectX-8 SuperNICs are confirmed to be a key component for the GB200 NVL72/36x2 configurations, providing up to 800Gb/s bandwidth per GPU. The "mass deployment of 800GbE ConnectX-8 NICs" is expected later in 2025, coinciding with the rollout of next-generation offerings like the B300 and GB300 NVL72. This indicates a planned ramp-up in ConnectX-8 availability and integration, which is essential for NVIDIA's advanced platforms.

While the physical availability of ConnectX-8 NICs as standalone components doesn't appear to be the primary gating factor, the intricate design and integration of these high-speed networking solutions within the GB200 racks have presented engineering challenges. Reports from late 2024 and early 2025 hinted at potential delays and revised shipment estimates for GB200 NVL72 due to various "unprecedented technology issues" encompassing thermal management, power, and networking. More recent reports (May 2025) indicate that GB200 rack shipments commenced at the end of Q1 2025, with production capacity "rapidly scaled up," suggesting some initial hurdles have been overcome.

However, Wall Street analysts are closely watching for confirmation that "supply bottlenecks have eased and that networking, NVLink systems, and Spectrum-X Ethernet are scaling in tandem" with the Blackwell platform. This underscores that the seamless integration and scaling of NVIDIA's entire networking stack, including ConnectX-8 SuperNICs, remain a critical focus for investors and could materially impact forward-looking guidance. Any further indications of delays or difficulties in scaling these networking components could be a non-consensus negative for NVIDIA's earnings and outlook.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1:**
- **Snippet:** "One engineer at an unnamed partner manufacturer of Nvidia reportedly told FT that internal testing revealed connectivity problems, requiring supply chain collaboration with Nvidia two or three months ago."
- **Date:** May 28, 2025
- **Source:** Tom's Hardware, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEf2lGkdYmtnTA33GymdIDKEX-c-ND3lj8eepUUjg4ZaeBp5284EQAIXfJgiRfdVSTV9kLluDJ07Vg8EAk2jMo3e9XYgH1Nk1Nc60SpSmtqrMdJvmj_S-KDSer2y4GYbGTQOCiZSPmNHW0K68i301PtIqjI453Eq_pEw2ZVmQHaMPFHGmGAtfhQBVo6zRt1Sh5nqAxR6hjS0CbrkTkf3qTvtuv-L6Rwx5wtrGRxVh4gxWVuWs6LLvph4KT2MQjkpgPOa2R-b1smLEZLYeNoKUeGSlrUoUD_6ZU2zq8tqIL_fmp56bDx
- **Impact:** High. This is a recent, specific detail about ongoing, complex technical issues related to interconnectivity within GB200 racks. While not explicitly naming NICs as the sole problem, "connectivity problems" directly involve the networking infrastructure, including NICs, and suggest that the integration challenges were still being actively addressed close to the earnings report.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general GB200 delays have been discussed, this specific detail about "connectivity problems" requiring recent supply chain collaboration is more granular and less widely known than broad statements about production ramp-up.

---

**Finding 2:**
- **Snippet:** "As the market closely follows the progress of NVIDIA's GB200 rack-mounted solution, TrendForce's latest research indicates that the supply chain requires additional time for optimization and adjustment. This is largely due to the higher design specifications of the GB200 rack, including its requirements for high-speed interconnect interfaces and thermal design power (TDP), which significantly exceed market norms. Consequently, TrendForce projects that mass production and peak shipments are unlikely to occur until between Q2 and Q3 of 2025."
- **Date:** December 17, 2024 (Note: While the article is from Dec 2024, the projection for peak shipments is Q2-Q3 2025, which is relevant to the current earnings period.)
- **Source:** TrendForce, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGj5EGFOme5Ww9MzkMKz1FZpCmyh4pGSc25F7pBFfQat3PJ0yUgm7G982X09nUPz3RnipxfgSOOKncD_ZFIrh72S8ktpI4kPxD__oziZJqKEHVB4BNN7LFBGIDGaixnNo3NiO4KjjhHz4cUHxtbLiWJepTvdDoDRwQEeg==
- **Impact:** Medium. This highlights that the "high-speed interconnect interfaces" (which include NICs) are a key reason for the extended optimization period for GB200. The projection of peak shipments in Q2-Q3 2025 suggests that the ramp-up is ongoing and not fully mature, potentially impacting current quarter results or near-term guidance.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific mention of "high-speed interconnect interfaces" as a contributing factor to the extended optimization is a more detailed aspect.

---

**Finding 3:**
- **Snippet:** "For the reference design, the GB200A NVL36 will use one Bluefield-3 frontend NIC per compute tray. This is a more reasonable design as compared to having two Bluefield-3 per compute tray for the GB200 NVL72 / 36×2. Even for the MGX NVL36, we still feel that many customers will not opt to use any Bluefield-3, but instead opt to use their own internal NIC in the case of hyperscalers or use a generic frontend NIC like a ConnectX-6/7. The heart of the GB200 NVL72/NVL36x2 compute tray is the Bianca board. ... On the GB200 NVL72 / 36×2, with ConnectX-8 backend NICs, each GPU would have access to up to 800G of bandwidth. For the reference design, the GB200A NVL36 will use one Bluefield-3 frontend NIC per compute tray."
- **Date:** August 4, 2024 (Note: While older, this provides architectural context for NIC usage in GB200.)
- **Source:** SemiAnalysis, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEh5Wvbx2p2YKbRsW7wLblY2jzdFGfbqK3LYJpOrM7_pnayaMYlzBnMsZQKLWwQV9K7liLr2gmX3Nt27VZ0qUhHZ61OzEBUHyHJ6ZDkSkMj0aQ3DyStDTqZruPCk8rkI6_DaokYpvddaqnDq8qtje-tVbrJKera3KgqMFSWZXwjTHI0bg==
- **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the specific role of ConnectX-8 NICs as "backend NICs" for the GB200 NVL72/36x2, delivering 800G bandwidth. It also highlights the architectural complexity and the choice between Bluefield-3 and ConnectX-8, indicating that NIC selection and integration are critical design considerations.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific architectural details of NIC integration within different GB200 configurations are likely known to industry insiders but not widely disseminated to the broader investment community.

**Finding 4:**
- **Snippet:** "Rumor: Microsoft has cut GB200 AI server orders 40% due to a problem with the backplane interconnect design that could delay mass production until March, 2025, media report, citing unnamed supply chain sources, and adding the problem is with a cartridge connector module made by a US company. ... The latest issue lies in the design of the backplane connector system. Due to suboptimal yield rates during testing of cartridge connectors produced by a major U.S.-based Tier-1 supplier, production may be delayed further, possibly until March 2025."
- **Date:** December 2, 2024 (Note: This is a rumor from late 2024, but the reported delay until March 2025 is relevant to the current quarter.)
- **Source:** Reddit (citing Industrial and Commercial Times), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE5kY4HfGXbxhpvT7UsVAhxj392RvyRu5EWIkzls1bTqpU5AN-bg0UFfqQO6qSBy0cvnCPsnLBkJS0FY15f5L9gpAUx6gUZ417rLGnLajEcRWD-ixvsbnFp4IQiMKF95FkAVrVS8G7i3xheStvEk1d-DEnOZkPZgUYBM0m0Va9WbHWJ9FoWELUDBHlIRfL5VNyJT1EuYMDQ__UA4bbiLqWAWg==
- **Impact:** High. While a rumor, a 40% cut in orders from a major hyperscaler like Microsoft due to "backplane interconnect design" issues would be highly material. This directly relates to the high-speed networking within the GB200 system, which NICs are a part of, and suggests that the interconnects were a significant bottleneck. The reported delay until March 2025 would have impacted Q1 FY2026 and potentially Q2 FY2206 shipments.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked (due to being a rumor and potentially older, but the impact if true is significant). The market may not have fully priced in such a substantial order cut specifically tied to interconnect design.

**Finding 5:**
- **Snippet:** "That puts a spotlight on Nvidia's networking business (NVLink, NVSwitch, Spectrum-X, ConnectX-8 SuperNICs), which many analysts see as an underappreciated growth engine. ... Investors will parse commentary on: Blackwell Ultra timing in 2H25 and its contribution split between training and inference. Supply chain capacity: TSMC CoWoS-L throughput, substrate availability, and the cadence of HBM3E adds from SK Hynix and Micron. Hyperscaler ordering patterns into 2026 and the extent to which sovereign AI projects backfill any digestion periods."
- **Date:** August 26, 2025
- **Source:** Wall Street Journal (via Vertex AI Search), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQERJ9aft0xktnUqQGJk8petlLej6znKmO8NIeZyluEkQL-w-iL8xsTUPKvcwBj9U-wolqPGSoGzkQofJ-riLKLmYln9Uv41p_RTImsg36Kh0FO6HlIY0-rAGNC4iqDdELMP2KHRk_RRMz9ngSfI4XmQG6tciwU1YGtw8spB8wMHrQmgmIwLgzbv695x_JDB36XiUmG5qDoxMzpXxz-rUmC4uRsRF-h9hK7tlKKsIP4Y8dDEzkDWq5CT4QCngcSPSh1XhhAd3dg64xybNnXIzLCm9rx6PuQKA3yGOGBeFaPmNUlT
- **Impact:** High. This is a very recent pre-earnings article highlighting that NVIDIA's networking business, including ConnectX-8 SuperNICs, is a key area of investor focus. It explicitly states that investors will be looking for confirmation that "networking, NVLink systems, and Spectrum-X Ethernet are scaling in tandem". Any negative commentary or lack of positive confirmation on this front could be material.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known that networking is important, but the emphasis on "scaling in tandem" and its direct link to investor scrutiny for this specific earnings report makes it a critical point of focus for non-consensus information.

---

**Finding 6:**
- **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's next-generation offerings such as the B300 HGX NVL8 and GB300 NVL72 will move to 800 Gbit/s per GPU, paired with the mass deployment of 800GbE ConnectX-8 NICs later this year."
- **Date:** June 16, 2025
- **Source:** Daniel Romero (via SemiAnalysis comparison), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHplt-Nkj4_hhyutXqErub7FIYavoVxIdCoxpiytrDJB9Lem3bnEevilK4WKdrLS3Js4Dns5KhxOrc0cSdxNtzlmfj6zzYDSk1oC-PjpcKbsDfgK0_fjh76Fq0syhARpL-ltJ9TdvvMVKt5BSRnLSflSmCXmPAdhZ9I93WPOA==
- **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the strategic importance and planned "mass deployment" of ConnectX-8 NICs for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms later in 2025. While not a direct bottleneck for *current* GB200 shipments, any indications of delays in this "mass deployment" could impact forward-looking guidance for future Blackwell derivatives.
- **Consensus Check:** Likely known to those following NVIDIA's roadmap closely, but the "mass deployment" aspect and its timing within "later this year" could be a point of non-consensus if there are any unexpected updates.
