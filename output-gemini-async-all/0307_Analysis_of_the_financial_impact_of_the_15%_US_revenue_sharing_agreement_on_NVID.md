## Analysis

NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report, due after market close today, is set against a backdrop of a newly implemented 15% US revenue-sharing agreement on specific AI chip sales to China. This unprecedented deal, confirmed in August 2025, allows NVIDIA to resume exports of its H20 chips to the crucial Chinese market, which had been largely restricted. While the agreement reopens a significant revenue stream, its financial implications, particularly on gross margins, present a complex and potentially non-consensus picture for investors.

Analysts are closely scrutinizing how the 15% levy, applied directly to topline revenue from these China sales, will impact NVIDIA's profitability. Estimates suggest a potential 5-15 percentage point reduction on gross margins for China-bound chips, with some analysts forecasting a one to four percentage point hit to NVIDIA's overall gross margins. This comes after Q1 FY2026 saw a notable decline in gross margins to 60.5% due to a $4.5 billion charge related to H20 inventory write-offs caused by the initial export ban. NVIDIA has previously guided for a recovery to approximately 71.8% gross margin in Q2, aiming for the mid-70% range by year-end, making the actual reported Q2 gross margin a critical metric to watch.

A key area of non-consensus revolves around the actual volume of China sales that will materialize under this new arrangement. While the deal theoretically enables the recovery of up to $8 billion in previously lost H20 revenue for Q2, some analysts did not factor these sales into their forecasts due to the late approval and reported "pushback" from Chinese authorities urging domestic firms to reduce purchases of U.S. chips. This divergence in analyst expectations creates potential for either a positive surprise if sales exceed conservative estimates or a negative one if Chinese demand remains subdued. The "unusual" nature of this revenue-sharing model, which critics have labeled a "creative taxation scheme," also raises questions about its long-term implications for U.S. tech companies operating in regulated markets. Investors will be seeking detailed commentary from management on the timing, materiality, and expected gross margin implications of this agreement during the earnings call.

    *   **Impact:** High. This provides specific, quantitative estimates of the direct gross margin compression on China-bound chips, which is central to the research objective.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While the general concept of margin impact is understood, the specific range of 5-15 percentage points for China-specific sales might not be uniformly incorporated into all analyst models.

*   **Snippet:** "But Nvidia could take a five to 15 percentage point hit to gross margins on China-bound chips due to the federal deal, with Bernstein analysts estimating it cutting about one point from Nvidia's overall margins. The company's adjusted gross margin is expected to drop nearly four percentage points to 72.1 per cent in the second quarter. In the October quarter, gross margin is expected to contract by nearly two points to 73.2 per cent."

    *   **Impact:** High. This offers specific analyst projections for the overall gross margin impact in Q2 and Q3, highlighting a potential range of outcomes (one point vs. nearly four percentage points overall reduction) that could lead to non-consensus views.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While analysts are adjusting their forecasts, the precise magnitude of the overall margin hit and the Q3 outlook might not be fully aligned across all market participants.

*   **Snippet:** "Last quarter, Nvidia delivered another blockbuster revenue print, but profits were dented by a $4.5B charge tied to new export licensing rules for China. Gross margins sank well below expectations to 60.5%... Gross margins: recovery to ~71.8% expected, after plunging to 60.5% in Q1 due to China restrictions."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This provides essential context for the Q2 gross margin expectations, showing the baseline from which recovery is anticipated before factoring in the new revenue-sharing impact.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The Q1 gross margin performance and the $4.5 billion charge were part of NVIDIA's previous earnings report and subsequent analyst coverage.

*   **Snippet:** "For Q2 2025, many analysts did not factor in H20 sales revenue in China because US approval arrived quite late, and China's pushback has made full-year forecasts harder to pin down... Assuming restriction removal doubles China sales while other regions remain flat, this could boost NVIDIA's revenue by over 10%. The benefits are expected to outweigh the 15% government levy, which could reduce total revenue by approximately 3% if China's share of sales rises to 25%."

    *   **Impact:** High. This highlights a significant non-consensus element. If a material portion of analysts excluded H20 sales from their Q2 forecasts, any actual sales could lead to a revenue beat and potentially a better-than-expected gross margin, despite the 15% cut.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. The indication that "many analysts did not factor in H20 sales revenue in China" for Q2 suggests a potential for surprise relative to current consensus estimates.

*   **Snippet:** "At the same time, Chinese authorities, despite strong demand for Nvidia's chips, have urged domestic firms to reduce purchases on security grounds... Beijing quietly started urging local companies to avoid using H20 chips especially for anything government related. This isn't an official ban that would be too obvious. Instead it's the kind of "gentle suggestion" that in China might as well be carved in stone."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This introduces a significant potential headwind to the revenue-sharing agreement's benefits. Even with export licenses, suppressed demand due to unofficial government guidance could limit actual sales volume and thus impact revenue and gross margins.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While some reports mention this, it might be overlooked by investors focusing primarily on the "resumption of sales" headline, making it a subtle but material non-consensus factor.

*   **Snippet:** "In May, Nvidia warned it could face an $8 billion hit from China export restrictions, and although the company recently struck a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration to resume sales of its H20 chip in China, Wednesday's report will still reflect the full impact of the restrictions. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday's results, but it should be factored into Nvidia's guidance."
    *   **Date:** August 25, 2025
    *   **Source:** Investopedia, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHMkQNRuUicEkWUwHJqe1J2G4iWQVPsBzTTmcFplvLp1rXqaUgeA6fIyo1uNsOoBX7cDe7yzARUDzqobkXGI_sosxXRznlqSHWb70bqo_WgD84_pggqhXz49ch_VNGm1s0QLJXt0exB499O3mq1qV2XZeCS2D5NxQkn
    *   **Impact:** High. This clarifies the timing of the financial impact. The revenue-sharing agreement's primary effect is likely on forward-looking guidance rather than Q2 FY2026 reported results, which is a crucial distinction for investor expectations.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. There's a slight contradiction in reporting, with some sources implying a Q2 impact from the deal, while this snippet explicitly states it's too late for Q2 results. This timing difference could be a source of non-consensus.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Q2 Impact Timing:** There is a minor contradiction regarding whether the revenue-sharing agreement will impact Q2 FY2026 reported results. Some sources suggest it could contribute to Q2 revenue, while others explicitly state it "came too late to have any impact on Wednesday's results" for Q2, but will influence guidance. This timing will be a key point for clarification during NVIDIA's earnings call.
*   **Magnitude of Overall Gross Margin Hit:** Analyst estimates for the overall gross margin reduction due to the 15% revenue share vary, from "about one point" to "nearly four percentage points". This range indicates a lack of full consensus on the precise financial impact on NVIDIA's consolidated gross margins.
*   **Actual China Demand:** Despite the export license agreement, the actual volume of H20 chips NVIDIA will be able to sell in China remains uncertain due to reported "pushback" from Chinese authorities. The extent to which this unofficial guidance will suppress demand is a significant unknown and a major gap in current information.
