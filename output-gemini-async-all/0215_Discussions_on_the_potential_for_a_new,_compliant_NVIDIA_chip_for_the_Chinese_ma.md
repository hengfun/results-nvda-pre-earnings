## Analysis

NVIDIA is navigating a complex and evolving landscape in the Chinese AI chip market, with recent developments pointing to both opportunities and challenges ahead of its Q2 FY2026 earnings report. While the company has secured a deal to resume sales of its H20 chips, the market is also anticipating a more advanced, compliant chip based on the Blackwell architecture. However, the effectiveness of these strategies is being influenced by the Chinese government's stance and a new revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government.

A significant, potentially non-consensus factor is the reported reluctance of Chinese regulators and companies to fully embrace the H20 chip, even after the U.S. lifted its export ban. This could temper the expected revenue boost from the resumed H20 sales. Simultaneously, NVIDIA is reportedly developing a new, more powerful AI chip for China, tentatively named B30A, based on its latest Blackwell architecture, with samples expected as early as September 2025. This forward-looking development could be crucial for NVIDIA's long-term market share in China, especially as the H20 is being perceived as "obsolete" by some.

Adding another layer of complexity, NVIDIA and AMD have agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of the revenue generated from specific AI chip sales to China. This unprecedented "revenue tax" will impact NVIDIA's profitability from the Chinese market, even as sales resume. The interplay of these factors creates a nuanced outlook for NVIDIA's performance in China, with both potential upside from new chip introductions and downside risks from geopolitical complexities and domestic competition.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "Nvidia is developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be more powerful than the H20 model it is currently allowed to sell there, two people briefed on the matter said. ... The new chip, tentatively known as the B30A, will use a single-die design that is likely to deliver half the raw computing power of the more sophisticated dual-die configuration in Nvidia's flagship B300 accelerator card... The chip's specifications are not completely finalised but Nvidia hopes to deliver samples to Chinese clients for testing as early as next month, said the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified."

- **Impact:** High. This is a forward-looking, material development. A new, more powerful compliant chip based on the latest Blackwell architecture, with samples expected as early as September 2025 (next month), indicates NVIDIA's proactive strategy to maintain its presence in the crucial Chinese market. This could significantly influence forward-looking guidance.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Emerging Consensus. While Reuters reported on it, the specific details and the "as early as next month" timeline for samples might not be fully priced into current expectations, especially given the recent focus on H20.

- **Snippet:** "Chinese regulators urged tech firms not to purchase the chip, and demand plummeted. Soon after, Nvidia halted production of the H20, which it had designed specifically for the Chinese market. Trump's deal with Jensen Huang, reached after months of lobbying from the Nvidia CEO and which included a 15% cut for the U.S. government on H20 sales to China, appeared to be a flop."

- **Impact:** High. This directly contradicts the positive sentiment around the resumption of H20 sales. If Chinese demand for H20 has "plummeted" due to government discouragement, the expected revenue recovery from H20 sales in Q2 FY2026 might be significantly lower than anticipated, impacting current earnings.
- **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. Many reports focus on the *lifting* of the H20 ban and the resumption of sales as a positive, but this snippet highlights a critical counter-narrative regarding actual demand and government influence.

- **Snippet:** "Nvidia is recalibrating its approach to the Chinese market. According to Reuters, the company has placed a new order for 300,000 H20 AI GPUs with chipmaker TSMC, spurred by a huge demand from Chinese tech giants including Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba."

- **Impact:** Medium. This snippet presents a direct contradiction to the previous one regarding H20 demand. While the previous snippet suggests plummeting demand and halted production, this one indicates "huge demand" and a new order for 300,000 units. This creates significant uncertainty around the actual sales volume of H20 in Q2 and beyond.
- **Consensus Check:** Contradictory. This directly opposes the "plummeting demand" narrative, indicating a lack of clear consensus on the H20's market performance in China.

- **Snippet:** "A significant development emerged in August 2025 where NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to share 15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licences. This arrangement allows NVIDIA to resume H20 AI chip sales designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export controls. The financial impact warrants attention. While China represents 13% of NVIDIA's revenue by customer billing location in FY 2025, actual contribution may be higher due to trans-shipment orders. ... The benefits are expected to outweigh the 15% government levy, which could reduce total revenue by approximately 3% if China's share of sales rises to 25%."

- **Impact:** Medium. While the 15% revenue-sharing agreement is widely known, the specific quantification of its potential impact (reducing total revenue by ~3% if China's share rises to 25%) provides a concrete financial detail that could influence margin expectations for Q2 and future guidance.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific financial impact is a valuable detail.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **H20 Demand:** There is a clear contradiction regarding the demand for H20 chips in China. Some reports suggest Chinese regulators are discouraging their purchase, leading to plummeting demand and halted production, while others indicate "huge demand" from major Chinese tech companies and a new order for 300,000 units. This divergence in reporting creates significant uncertainty about the actual revenue contribution from H20 sales in the upcoming earnings report.
*   **Regulatory Approval for B30A:** While NVIDIA is reportedly developing the B30A and aiming for samples next month, the sources explicitly state that "US regulatory approval is far from guaranteed". This is a critical gap, as the chip's market entry is contingent on this approval, adding a layer of risk to its potential impact on future guidance.
*   **Long-term Chinese Strategy:** The reports highlight China's push for self-reliance and the rise of domestic alternatives like Huawei's Ascend chips. Even with compliant NVIDIA chips, the long-term market share and growth potential for NVIDIA in China remain uncertain due to these geopolitical and competitive pressures.
