## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is reporting its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, for the quarter ending July 2025. As a pre-earnings research analyst, the focus is on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding the impact of USD-TWD currency exchange rates on TSMC-NVIDIA costs and NVIDIA's Q3 guidance margins. Recent developments indicate a strengthening New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) and its subsequent effects on TSMC's profitability, which is a critical factor for NVIDIA's cost of goods sold (COGS) given TSMC is its primary foundry partner.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) has experienced a significant appreciation against the U.S. Dollar (USD) in recent months, particularly a rapid 7% rise in May 2025 and an overall appreciation of over 10% in Q2 2025. This strengthening currency directly impacts TSMC, NVIDIA's key manufacturing partner, by effectively increasing its operating expenses when converted back to foreign currencies. TSMC has explicitly stated that unfavorable foreign exchange rates, alongside the dilution from ramping up overseas fabrication plants, negatively affected its Q2 2025 gross margins and are projected to continue impacting Q3 2025 margins and persist for the next five years.

In response to these cost pressures and robust demand for advanced chips, TSMC has been implementing price increases for its advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, including 3nm, 5nm, and advanced packaging technologies like CoWoS. Notably, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has publicly acknowledged that TSMC's wafer prices are "indeed too low," suggesting a potential willingness from NVIDIA to absorb these higher costs. While NVIDIA possesses significant pricing power and is expected to pass on most cost increases to its customers, the cumulative effect of a rapidly appreciating NTD, TSMC's resulting margin compression, and the foundry's subsequent price hikes could present a more pronounced headwind to NVIDIA's gross margins than widely anticipated, particularly for its Q3 FY2026 guidance. This confluence of factors, especially the long-term nature of TSMC's margin pressures from overseas fab expansion and FX, could be a non-consensus element impacting NVIDIA's forward-looking profitability.

**Structured Findings:**

**1. TSMC's Q2 2025 Gross Margin Impacted by Unfavorable FX and Overseas Fabs**
*   **Snippet:** "Gross margin decreased 0.2 percentage points sequentially to 58.6%, affected by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate and margin dilution from overseas fabs."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-17
*   **Source:** Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript Summary, Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, quantifiable impact on NVIDIA's primary foundry's profitability for the quarter ending July 2025, which directly feeds into NVIDIA's COGS.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that TSMC faces FX risks, but the specific 0.2 percentage point sequential decrease and the dual reasons (FX and overseas fabs) might not be fully priced into NVIDIA's expectations.

**2. TSMC's Q3 2025 Gross Margin Guidance Reflects Persistent FX and Fab Dilution Pressures**
*   **Snippet:** "Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD1 to TWD29, gross margin is expected to be between 55.5% and 57.5%; operating margin between 45.5% and 47.5%. ... Compared to first quarter, our second-quarter gross margin slightly decreased by 20 basis points sequentially to 58.6%. ... We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decrease by 210 basis points to 56.5% at the midpoint, primarily due to the continued unfavorable foreign exchange rate and more pronounced dilution from overseas fabs as we ramp up further in Kumamoto and Arizona. What I found a bit disappointing is the fact that these pressures will persist, likely for the next 5 years."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-17, 2025-08-27
*   **Source:** Q2 2025 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd Earnings Call (Chinese, English) - TSMC Investor Relations; Taiwan Semiconductor: Ultra Bullish On Nvidia's (Likely) B30/B30A To China, Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** High. TSMC's explicit guidance for a 210 basis point sequential decrease in Q3 gross margin, driven by both FX and overseas fab dilution, directly signals higher costs for NVIDIA. The long-term (5-year) persistence of these pressures is a material, non-consensus factor for NVIDIA's long-term margin outlook.
*   **Consensus Check:** The specific magnitude of the Q3 guidance decrease and the explicit 5-year outlook for these pressures, particularly the combined effect of FX and fab dilution, may be overlooked by some analysts focusing solely on demand.

**3. TSMC Price Increases and NVIDIA CEO's Acknowledgment of "Too Low" Prices**
*   **Snippet:** "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is planning to increase the prices for its advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes this year. Earlier predictions suggested a modest rise—around 3% for processes like 5nm and smaller, and about 5% for advanced packaging technologies such as CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate). However, recent developments indicate these increases might be higher than initially expected. One main reason for the price adjustments is strong market demand. ... Another important factor is the appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar. ... TSMC has already raised prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%."
*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA CEO Huang Renxun apparently agrees with this view. Huang Renxun said: 'TSMC's wafer prices are indeed too low. I think TSMC's (service) prices are too low, and TSMC's contribution to the world and the technology industry is underestimated by its financial performance.' ... Morgan Stanley believes that due to the demand for AI semiconductors, TSMC may further increase prices by 5% in 2025. We believe that if NVIDIA accepts price increases, other key AI and semiconductor customers may follow suit."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-09, 2025-08-25 (TSMC price increases); 2025-08-22 (Huang's quote, reiterated)
*   **Source:** TSMC Raises Prices on Advanced Chip Manufacturing Amid Strong Demand and Currency Changes - www.guru3d.com; Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast (Aug 2025); Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM.US) plans to raise prices for Nvidia. Deutsche Bank says other customers may follow suit.
*   **Impact:** High. TSMC's confirmed and anticipated price increases directly raise NVIDIA's COGS. Jensen Huang's public statement suggests NVIDIA's potential acceptance of these increases, which could lead to a higher-than-expected cost burden for NVIDIA, even with its strong pricing power.
*   **Consensus Check:** While TSMC's pricing power is known, the specific magnitude of recent increases and Huang's explicit comment about TSMC's prices being "too low" could be a non-consensus signal that NVIDIA's gross margins might face more pressure than generally assumed, even if partially offset by NVIDIA's own price adjustments.

**4. Rapid Appreciation of New Taiwan Dollar in Q2 2025**
*   **Snippet:** "The report notes that on May 2, the USD/NTD exchange rate stood at 1 USD to 32.1266 NTD. Just three days later, on May 5, it had dropped to 29.6710—marking a rapid 7% appreciation of the NTD. This sudden shift caught many exporters off guard and is expected to significantly affect financial performance across the tech sector. ... In the second quarter of 2025, the NT dollar appreciated by more than 10%, hitting export-oriented industries hardest."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-06, 2025-08-01
*   **Source:** [News] New Taiwan Dollar Rises Rapidly, Pressuring TSMC and MediaTek Margins, TechNews; TSMC states exchange rates are uncontrollable as Taiwan's foundry sector faces significant pressure in 3Q25 - DIGITIMES Asia
*   **Impact:** Medium. This provides the underlying context for TSMC's currency-related margin pressures. The speed and magnitude of the NTD appreciation could have caught some off guard, leading to a more significant impact on TSMC's costs than a gradual currency shift.
*   **Consensus Check:** General awareness of currency fluctuations exists, but the specific rapid 7% appreciation in three days and the overall 10%+ appreciation in Q2 2025 might be a more acute and less widely detailed factor in consensus models for NVIDIA's COGS.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding the direction of the USD-TWD exchange rate impact on TSMC's costs. All sources indicate a strengthening TWD negatively impacts TSMC's margins.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   NVIDIA has not explicitly quantified the direct impact of USD-TWD exchange rates on its own Q2 FY2026 results or Q3 FY2026 guidance. The impact is inferred from TSMC's disclosures.
    *   While NVIDIA's strong pricing power is noted, the exact extent to which it can fully offset TSMC's price increases and FX-related cost pressures without impacting its own gross margins is not precisely detailed in the available information.
    *   Specific details on NVIDIA's hedging strategies against TWD appreciation are not available in the provided snippets.
