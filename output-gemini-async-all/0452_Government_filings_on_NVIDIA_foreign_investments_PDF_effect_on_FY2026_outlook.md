## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the most material and potentially non-consensus information identified within the last three months pertains to a recent U.S. government revenue-sharing agreement concerning NVIDIA's AI chip sales to China. This development directly impacts the previously communicated revenue losses due to export controls and introduces a new dynamic of government involvement in private sector sales.

NVIDIA is scheduled to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings (quarter ending July 2025) after market close today, August 27, 2025. While the market is aware of the U.S. export restrictions on H20 chips to China, the specifics of the resolution and its full financial implications, particularly the 15% revenue share with the U.S. government, may not be entirely priced into consensus estimates.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "A significant development emerged in August 2025 where NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to share 15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licences. This arrangement allows NVIDIA to resume H20 AI chip sales designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export controls."
    *   **Date:** August 21, 2025 (FastBull), August 25, 2025 (IG Singapore)
    *   **Source:** FastBull, "How will AI growth and US-China deal shape NVIDIA's Q2 results?",; IG Singapore, "NVIDIA Q2 earnings preview: AI growth, China chip deal, analyst forecast",
    *   **Impact:** High. This is a critical development that directly addresses the previously guided $8 billion revenue loss for Q2 FY2026 due to H20 export restrictions. The resumption of sales, even with a levy, could lead to an upside surprise if the market had fully discounted the $8 billion loss.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. While some analysts like KeyBanc have reportedly adjusted their Q2 revenue estimates upwards based on this deal, the full market may not have fully incorporated the implications of resumed sales or the unusual nature of the government's direct revenue share.

*   **Snippet:** "The stalemate ended only after Huang met with President Trump and agreed to a deal: the licenses would be granted, but the U.S. Treasury would get 15% of all H20 revenue from China. AMD agreed to identical terms for its MI308 chip. Two days later, both companies had their licenses. The numbers are staggering. Bernstein Research estimates Nvidia could sell $15 billion worth of H20 chips in China this year, and AMD about $800 million of MI308s. That is more than $2 billion flowing straight to Washington, not as taxes but as a contractual price for market access."
    *   **Date:** August 27, 2025
    *   **Source:** Advisor Perspectives, "If the Government Can Take A 15% Cut From Nvidia, Who Is Next?",
    *   **Impact:** High. This snippet provides specific details on the 15% revenue share and a significant estimated sales figure ($15 billion for H20 chips in China this year) that could now be realized. The direct involvement of the U.S. Treasury taking a "contractual price for market access" is an unusual and potentially overlooked aspect of the deal's long-term implications.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus regarding the nature and precedent of the deal. While the fact of the deal is becoming known, the qualitative implications of the government acting as a "business partner" and the "legality questioned" aspects might not be fully appreciated or priced in by all investors.

*   **Snippet:** "On April 9, 2025, NVIDIA was informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. ... This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
    *   **Date:** May 28, 2025
    *   **Source:** NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This provides the baseline for the market's previous expectations regarding H20 sales. The $8.0 billion projected loss for Q2 FY2026 is the figure against which the impact of the new revenue-sharing agreement will be measured.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This information was part of NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 earnings report and guidance for Q2, and is widely cited across various financial news outlets.

*   **Snippet:** "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the U.S. government is not considering taking a stake in chipmaker Nvidia due to the company's strong financial position."
    *   **Date:** August 27, 2025
    *   **Source:** ScanX, "U.S. Treasury Rules Out Stake in Nvidia, Eyes Other Strategic Industries",
    *   **Impact:** Low. While new information released today, this largely confirms the expected status quo given NVIDIA's strong financial performance. It removes a potential, albeit unlikely, overhang of direct government ownership intervention but does not introduce a new material financial opportunity or restriction.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked, but likely low impact. The market likely did not anticipate a government stake in NVIDIA, so this confirmation is unlikely to significantly move the stock.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report will be heavily scrutinized for any updates on its China business, especially following the recent U.S. government revenue-sharing agreement. Previously, NVIDIA had guided for an $8 billion revenue loss in Q2 due to export restrictions on its H20 chips. However, the August 2025 agreement, which allows NVIDIA to resume H20 sales to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue to the U.S. Treasury, could significantly alter this outlook.

This deal, reportedly brokered after direct engagement with the U.S. President, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reopens a crucial market that was previously constrained, potentially allowing NVIDIA to recoup a substantial portion of the lost revenue. Bernstein Research estimates this could lead to $15 billion in H20 sales in China this year, with $2 billion going to the U.S. government. This suggests a potential upside to NVIDIA's Q2 and full-year FY2026 guidance if the market had fully priced in the $8 billion loss.

On the other hand, the nature of this agreement—where the government takes a direct percentage of private sales—is unusual and has raised questions about its legality and the precedent it sets for future government intervention in strategic industries. While it provides immediate market access, it also introduces a new cost structure and a qualitative shift in the regulatory landscape that could be a long-term concern for investors. The market's reaction to the specifics of this "contractual price for market access" will be key.

While some analysts have already begun to adjust their estimates upwards, the full extent to which this complex arrangement and its implications are understood and priced in by the broader market remains a non-consensus element. Investors will be looking for management commentary on the expected volume of H20 sales under this new agreement, the net revenue impact after the 15% levy, and any further clarity on the long-term regulatory environment for its China business.

A separate, less impactful, but recent piece of news is the U.S. Treasury Secretary ruling out a government stake in NVIDIA, citing the company's strong financial position. This removes a potential, albeit unlikely, overhang of direct government ownership.

    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked, but likely low impact. Unlikely to significantly influence earnings or guidance.
