## Analysis

NVIDIA is poised to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, with analysts widely anticipating strong revenue and EPS driven by the insatiable demand for AI chips. While the consensus outlook remains largely bullish, a deeper dive into recent reports reveals several material, non-consensus data points and potential overlooked factors that could influence the upcoming report and forward-looking guidance, particularly concerning gross margins.

The company's Q1 FY2026 gross margins were significantly impacted by a $4.5 billion charge related to H20 chip export restrictions to China, causing them to plunge to 60.5% (GAAP) from an expected 70.6%. For Q2, management has guided for a recovery to approximately 71.8% to 72.0% gross margins, with a target of mid-70% margins later in the year. However, the ongoing implications of the Blackwell platform ramp and the nuanced situation with China exports present areas where non-consensus views could emerge.

### Structured Findings:

---

**Finding 1: Projected FY2026 Gross Margin Compression Due to Blackwell Manufacturing Costs**

*   **Snippet:** "Additionally, the costs associated with scaling Blackwell manufacturing have pressured gross margins, which are projected to decline to 74.1% for FY 2026. This margin compression, while temporary, underscores the need for investors to balance short-term profitability concerns with the long-term potential of AI-driven demand." "The consensus gross profit margin for the Data Center segment for FY 2026 continued to decrease, falling over 100bps to 74.1% from the 75.2% estimated at the end of last quarter. The figure stood at 78% in FY 2024 and FY 2025."
*   **Date:** August 23, 2025, August 21, 2025
*   **Source:** AInvest, S&P Global
*   **Impact:** High. While Q2 margins are expected to recover, a projected decline in the full FY2026 gross margin to 74.1% from 78% in prior years, attributed to Blackwell manufacturing costs, suggests a longer-term margin pressure that might not be fully priced into the immediate Q2 expectations. This could impact forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The immediate focus is on Q2 recovery, but the full-year margin outlook, specifically the decline from previous years due to Blackwell ramp-up costs, could be a non-consensus concern for long-term profitability.

**Finding 2: Analyst Downgrades and Conservative EPS Estimates for Q2 FY2026**

*   **Snippet:** "On the other hand, the Wall Street sentiment around Nvidia's upcoming earnings release is slightly more bearish since down revisions prevailed over upgrades over the last 90 days. This is a two-edged sword though, because beating conservative forecasts will be easier for NVDA." "It looks like some analysts were downgrading their models' inputs for the company to make 'Nvidia's life easier' when it comes to beating the upcoming Q2." "Specifically for the upcoming Q2, the analysts lifted the EPS consensus by just 0.19% and 0.35% over the past 30 and 90 days, respectively, and it came amid the U.S. administration's approval of Nvidia's chip exports to China in July."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025, August 13, 2025
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** Medium. While the overall sentiment is bullish, the prevalence of downward revisions and conservative EPS estimates over the last 90 days suggests that the market might be setting a lower bar for NVIDIA to clear. This could lead to a larger-than-expected "beat" on EPS, potentially driving a positive stock reaction, which is a non-consensus upside.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The general bullish narrative might overshadow the subtle shift towards more conservative analyst estimates, creating an opportunity for a positive surprise.

**Finding 3: Wide Range of Blackwell Revenue Forecasts for Q2 FY2026**

*   **Snippet:** "There are questions around the outlook for Nvidia's new solution, Blackwell... Forecasts from 11 sources range from $7.3 billion to $34.0 billion in Q2, with consensus at $20.4 billion. This has triggered debate about the Data Center segment's future performance."
*   **Date:** August 21, 2025
*   **Source:** S&P Global
*   **Impact:** High. The extremely wide range in analyst forecasts for Blackwell B-series revenue in Q2 ($7.3 billion to $34.0 billion) highlights significant uncertainty regarding the actual ramp and adoption of NVIDIA's next-gen platform. A reported figure significantly above or below the $20.4 billion consensus could materially impact earnings and guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Blackwell's importance is known, the sheer breadth of revenue estimates suggests a lack of firm consensus on its immediate financial contribution, making it a key area for potential surprise.

**Finding 4: Ambiguity on H20 China Sales Recovery vs. Loss in Q2 FY2026**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations." "Resumed H20 chip sales to China aim to recover $8B in Q2 2026 after $2.5B Q1 loss, but geopolitical risks and performance limitations persist."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025, August 23, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA (via Stock Titan), AInvest
*   **Impact:** Medium. NVIDIA's official Q2 guidance explicitly reflects an $8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue due to export controls. However, one source mentions an *aim to recover* $8 billion in Q2 from resumed H20 sales. If the "aim" translates to actual sales that *offset* the guided loss, it would represent a significant non-consensus upside. Conversely, if the loss is fully realized as guided, it confirms the consensus negative impact. The ambiguity lies in whether any recovery is already factored into the "loss" or if it's a potential upside not fully anticipated.
*   **Consensus Check:** Contradictory/Nuanced. The official guidance points to a loss, which is largely consensus. However, the mention of "resumed sales aiming to recover" introduces a non-consensus possibility of mitigating or even reversing this loss in Q2, which would be a significant positive surprise if it materializes beyond current expectations.

**Finding 5: Potential for Higher Net Margin in Q2 FY2026 due to Operating Leverage**

*   **Snippet:** "I think we can take 54-55% as a close Q2 FY2026 assumption because on a TTM basis, at 70.1% GP margin, Nvidia holds a 51.69% profit margin (logically, if they have 72% in GP margin now in Q2, the operating leverage effect can send their net margin higher than the TTM figure)." "With the GP margin expected to come in at 72% (non-GAAP) and OPEX coming in at $4 billion (also non-GAAP), I think that Nvidia should basically keep its massive operating leverage in place for now, and this assumption of mine contradicts the consensus EPS YoY growth priced in right now."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025, August 13, 2025
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** Medium. While gross margins are a key focus, this analyst suggests that NVIDIA's operating leverage, combined with the expected 72% gross margin and $4 billion non-GAAP OPEX, could lead to a net margin of 54-55% for Q2, which is higher than the TTM figure of 51.69%. This could result in an EPS beat that is not fully reflected in current consensus, especially if analysts have been conservative (as noted in Finding 2).
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The focus is often on gross margin, but the impact of operating leverage on net margin and EPS could be a non-consensus driver of outperformance.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

The primary contradiction lies in the interpretation of H20 chip sales to China for Q2 FY2026. NVIDIA's official guidance explicitly reflects an $8.0 billion *loss* in H20 revenue due to export controls. However, one source mentions "Resumed H20 chip sales to China *aim to recover* $8B in Q2 2026". This creates a gap: is the "aim to recover" already factored into the $8 billion loss, or does it represent a potential upside that could mitigate or even reverse this expected loss, thus being a significant non-consensus positive? Given the earnings are today, it's highly likely the guided loss is the consensus expectation, and any significant recovery would be a surprise.

Another potential gap is the precise impact of Blackwell's ramp on gross margins. While some sources indicate manufacturing costs are pressuring FY2026 margins, others highlight Blackwell's superior performance and pricing power. The net effect on Q2 and future gross margins, beyond the guided 71.8-72.0%, remains a critical area of uncertainty.
