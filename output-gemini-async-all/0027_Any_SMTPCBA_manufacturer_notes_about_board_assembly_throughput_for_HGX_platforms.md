## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on NVIDIA's (NVDA) supply chain, focusing on material, non-consensus information regarding HGX platform and next-generation AI server board assembly throughput from key manufacturers. The analysis is based on web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025 - August 27, 2025).

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report is poised to reveal the extent of its next-generation Blackwell platform's ramp-up. Recent supply chain intelligence suggests a robust, albeit tightly managed, production environment. A significant non-consensus data point is NVIDIA's reported move to secure an *entire* Wistron server plant in Taiwan through 2026 for Blackwell and Rubin AI server production. This indicates aggressive capacity booking to meet "crazy" demand and suggests that while demand is exceptionally high, NVIDIA is actively working to lock in supply. Wistron's collective capacity for Blackwell-based systems is estimated at 240,000 units per quarter, but even with this, the company has warned that demand might outstrip capacity by 2026, hinting at potential future supply constraints despite current efforts.

Quanta Computer has already begun shipping GB200 servers in Q2 FY2026 and is actively testing the even newer GB300 systems, targeting September 2025 for mass production. This rapid progression across product generations, with multiple Taiwanese manufacturers (including Foxconn and Wiwynn) also targeting September for GB300 mass production, underscores the intense pace of AI infrastructure deployment. While past reports indicated TSMC's CoWoS-L packaging constraints and other issues for Blackwell, NVIDIA has reportedly resolved these, which is a critical positive for throughput. CEO Jensen Huang's characterization of Blackwell's ramp as the "fastest in company history" and its significant contribution to data center revenue further reinforces the strong production and assembly momentum, suggesting that manufacturers are largely keeping pace with the "amazing" demand.

The primary gap in the recent information is highly specific, granular details on SMT/PCBA throughput for HGX platforms from each individual manufacturer within the last three months. Most recent reports focus on the newer Blackwell/GB200/GB300 platforms, which are likely superseding or integrating with HGX designs. However, the general sentiment across the supply chain points to high demand and dedicated efforts by manufacturers to meet NVIDIA's aggressive targets for its AI server platforms.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "To ensure that its clients get the Blackwell and Rubin-based machines they need, Nvidia this week booked an entire Wistron server plant in Taiwan to build AI servers, according to Economic Daily. Wistron's facility near Zhubei in the Southern Taiwan Science Park began production this quarter and was officially inaugurated on June 19. Economic Daily claims Nvidia has secured all available capacity at the plant, with confirmed orders extending through 2026."

    - **Impact:** High. This indicates NVIDIA's aggressive strategy to secure dedicated manufacturing capacity for its next-generation AI servers (Blackwell and Rubin) through 2026. This commitment from a major ODM like Wistron suggests strong, sustained demand and a proactive approach to managing supply.
    - **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general demand for Blackwell is known, the specific detail of booking an *entire* plant's capacity through 2026 is a strong, non-consensus data point regarding dedicated capacity and potential supply limitations for others.

- **Snippet:** "While specific production capacity figures for this single plant are not publicly known, Wistron's collective 7 plants, employing over 7,000 people, are estimated to produce ~240,000 Blackwell-based AI systems per quarter. ... Due to the rapid growth in demand, Wistron has warned that its current capacity may not be sufficient by 2026."

    - **Impact:** High. Provides a concrete, albeit estimated, figure for Wistron's Blackwell system production capacity and a forward-looking warning about potential capacity insufficiency by 2026. This suggests that even with significant production, demand is expected to continue outpacing supply in the medium term.
    - **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Specific production numbers and forward-looking capacity warnings from a key supplier are likely not fully priced into consensus estimates.

- **Snippet:** "Quanta Computer began shipping predecessor GB200 servers in Q2 2025 and is currently conducting verification testing for GB300 systems with enterprise customers. Their September shipping target reflects the compressed timeframes driving modern AI infrastructure deployment."

    - **Impact:** Medium. Confirms active shipments of GB200 servers in the current quarter (NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026) and rapid progress towards the next-generation GB300, indicating strong and continuous demand for NVIDIA's latest AI server platforms.
    - **Consensus Check:** Widely known that Quanta is a partner, but the specific "September shipping target" for GB300 and "compressed timeframes" could imply a faster-than-expected transition or stronger demand pulling in timelines, which might be a slight positive surprise.

- **Snippet:** "Taiwanese manufacturers including Foxconn, Quanta, and Wiwynn are targeting September 2025 shipment timelines for mass production [of GB300 AI servers]."

    - **Impact:** Medium. This broad alignment of major manufacturers for GB300 mass production by September 2025 signals a strong and coordinated ramp-up for NVIDIA's future product pipeline, which will be a key factor in forward-looking guidance.
    - **Consensus Check:** While the partnerships are known, the specific "September 2025 shipment timelines for mass production" of GB300 across multiple key players could be a slightly positive non-consensus detail regarding the speed of the next-gen ramp.

- **Snippet:** "The company has faced numerous supply chain challenges, particularly because of its advanced packaging requirements. TSMC's CoWoS-L capacity constraints and packaging issues have led to delivery delays for Blackwell chips, though Nvidia reports these problems have been resolved."

    - **Impact:** Medium. This addresses a critical concern regarding Blackwell production. The reported resolution of TSMC's CoWoS-L capacity and packaging issues is a positive indicator for increased throughput and could alleviate investor concerns about supply bottlenecks impacting current and future quarters.
    - **Consensus Check:** This is likely a key point of discussion for earnings. The "resolved" part might be a non-consensus positive if the market is still pricing in significant ongoing constraints.

- **Snippet:** "Nvidia's newest Blackwell chips have become the fastest product ramp in the company's history, generating $11 billion in revenue in their first quarter of availability. CEO Jensen Huang described demand for Blackwell as "amazing," with the chips representing 50% of data center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025."

    - **Impact:** High. While not directly about SMT/PCBA, the statement of "fastest product ramp in the company's history" for Blackwell chips strongly implies exceptionally high and efficient production and assembly throughput from its manufacturing partners. This provides a powerful qualitative indicator of current performance and future potential.
    - **Consensus Check:** The general sentiment of strong Blackwell demand is known, but the specific "fastest product ramp" is a strong qualitative statement that might be overlooked in its full implications for manufacturing capacity and execution.
