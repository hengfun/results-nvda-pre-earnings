## Analysis

**Analysis of Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Their Potential Impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 Earnings**

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, an analysis of recent currency exchange rate fluctuations reveals potential headwinds for the company's international revenue and gross margins, primarily through its supply chain. While direct, non-consensus information specifically quantifying NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 currency impact is scarce in public domains, insights from its key foundry partner, TSMC, and broader currency trends suggest a nuanced picture.

A significant finding indicates that TSMC, NVIDIA's primary chip manufacturer, experienced a 220 basis point headwind to its Q2 2025 gross margin due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. This specific impact on a critical supply chain partner could indirectly affect NVIDIA's cost of goods sold and, consequently, its gross margins, a factor that may not be fully priced into consensus estimates.

Broader currency movements during the quarter show a mixed environment. While some earlier forecasts anticipated a weakening US Dollar due to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts in June and July 2025, more recent observations from August suggest a rebound in the USD against several major currencies, including the Euro and Chinese Yuan. This late-quarter strengthening of the USD could present an unexpected headwind for NVIDIA's international sales when translated back into US Dollars, potentially contradicting earlier, more optimistic currency assumptions.

The semiconductor industry, in general, has acknowledged currency fluctuations as a risk factor for Q2 2025, as noted by other industry players like Tower Semiconductor. Additionally, the ongoing geopolitical landscape, including potential tariff threats from the US, adds another layer of uncertainty that could influence currency stability and international trade for tech companies.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC's gross margin dipped to 58.6% in Q2 2025, partly due to capital expenditures and foreign exchange pressures. ... Compared to the first quarter, foreign exchange rate of $1 to 32.88 NT, the actual second quarter exchange rate was $1 to 31.05 NT. This created about 220 basis points margin headwind to our actual second quarter gross margin."
    *   **Date:** August 21, 2025
    *   **Source:** Earnings call transcript: TSMC sees 60.7% EPS growth in Q2 2025 - Investing.com,
    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, quantifiable impact on NVIDIA's primary foundry partner during the relevant quarter. A 220 basis point margin headwind for TSMC suggests higher input costs for NVIDIA, which could pressure NVIDIA's own gross margins if not fully offset by pricing or hedging.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While TSMC's earnings are public, the specific flow-through impact of this 220 bps FX headwind on NVIDIA's cost of goods sold and gross margin might not be explicitly modeled or fully appreciated by all analysts.

*   **Snippet:** "Macroeconomic pressures, including currency fluctuations, pose risks."
    *   **Date:** August 21, 2025
    *   **Source:** Earnings call transcript: Tower Semiconductor Q2 2025 beats expectations - Investing.com,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This is a general statement from another semiconductor company, indicating that currency fluctuations were a recognized industry-wide risk during Q2 2025. It reinforces the theme but lacks NVIDIA-specific quantification.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. General macroeconomic risks are typically considered, but the specific magnitude for NVIDIA is not detailed here.

*   **Snippet:** "After yesterday's pullback, the US dollar has rebounded. It is trading its best level against several of the G10 currencies since Fed Chair Powell spoke at Jackson Hole before the weekend. Most emerging market currencies are weaker, too, with the notable exception of the pegged Hong Kong dollar, and the Thai baht. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at a new low for the year, but the greenback is firmer against both the onshore and offshore yuan."
    *   **Date:** August 27, 2025
    *   **Source:** US Dollar comes back bid - FXStreet,
    *   **Impact:** High. A strengthening USD, particularly towards the end of the quarter and into the guidance period, can create headwinds for US-based multinational companies like NVIDIA when converting international sales back into USD. This is current information, highly relevant for forward guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While general USD movements are tracked, the timing of this rebound (late Q2/early Q3) might catch some models off guard, especially if earlier forecasts (like MUFG's below) predicted continued USD weakness.

*   **Snippet:** "In April the US dollar weakened notably against the euro in terms of London closing rates, from 1.0811 to 1.1325. In addition, the dollar weakened sharply against the yen, from 149.69 to 142.85. ... We have maintained that the first rate cut in the series for 2025 would start in June, however we have tweaked our forecast to expect back-to-back cuts versus our original view of the Fed cutting at every other meeting. We have 3 cuts of 25bps in June, July and September."
    *   **Date:** May 1, 2025
    *   **Source:** Monthly Foreign Exchange Outlook - MUFG Research,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This forecast from early in the quarter predicted USD weakness, which would have been a tailwind for NVIDIA. However, the more recent FXStreet report (August 27) suggests a USD rebound. This contradiction highlights a potential shift in currency trends that could impact NVIDIA's actual Q2 results versus earlier expectations.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus (due to contradiction). If analysts relied on this earlier forecast, the actual USD strength observed later in the quarter could be a surprise.

*   **Snippet:** "Trump also threatened additional tariffs and export controls in retaliation against digital services taxes that hit American technology companies, per Bloomberg. ... Market sentiment turned cautious after President Trump, in an Oval Office meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday, warned that he may impose a 200% tariff on Chinese goods if China refuses to supply magnets to the United States (US), amid Beijing's tighter control over rare earth mining."
    *   **Date:** August 25, 2025
    *   **Source:** USD/JPY falls below 147.50 following fresh threats from Trump - Mitrade,
    *   **Impact:** Medium. While not a direct currency fluctuation, the threat of tariffs and export controls, particularly against China, can significantly impact global trade flows and currency valuations, creating an uncertain environment for multinational tech companies like NVIDIA. This could influence forward guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known (geopolitical risks). However, the specific timing and severity of these renewed threats could add a fresh layer of concern that might not be fully integrated into all models.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** MUFG's May 2025 outlook predicted USD weakness due to anticipated Fed rate cuts in June and July, which would generally benefit US exporters. However, FXStreet's August 27, 2025, report indicates a recent rebound and strengthening of the USD against major currencies. This divergence in expected versus observed USD strength could lead to unexpected currency translation impacts for NVIDIA.
*   **Gaps:** There is no direct, specific, and quantifiable non-consensus information detailing the precise impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on NVIDIA's *own* international revenue or specific hedging effectiveness for Q2 FY2026. The findings are primarily derived from industry trends and a key supply chain partner.
