## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, a review of recent web content published within the last three months reveals emerging competitive pressures in the AI inference market from specialized chip developers like Cerebras and Groq. These companies are actively publishing performance metrics and customer case studies that highlight their solutions' superior speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for specific AI workloads, particularly large language model (LLM) inference, directly challenging NVIDIA's GPU dominance.

While NVIDIA remains the market leader, the detailed benchmarks and customer adoptions by Cerebras and Groq suggest a nascent but growing trend of displacement in production AI inference. This non-consensus information could impact NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance if these alternative architectures gain further traction, especially in latency-sensitive or cost-optimized applications.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Cerebras has beaten the Llama 4 Maverick inference speed record set by NVIDIA last week... Artificial Analysis has benchmarked Cerebras' Llama 4 Maverick endpoint at 2,522 tokens per second, compared to NVIDIA Blackwell's 1,038 tokens per second for the same model. We've tested dozens of vendors, and Cerebras is the only inference solution that outperforms Blackwell for Meta's flagship model."
    *   **Date:** May 28, 2025
    *   **Source:** Business Wire, Cerebras.net
    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, recent, and independently benchmarked comparison against NVIDIA's latest architecture (Blackwell) for a significant LLM (Llama 4 Maverick). Cerebras demonstrating more than double the inference performance is a material challenge to NVIDIA's perceived leadership in cutting-edge AI. The claim that NVIDIA used custom software optimizations not available to most users further highlights Cerebras's accessible advantage.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Cerebras is actively promoting this, the broader market narrative still heavily favors NVIDIA. This specific, recent benchmark against Blackwell is likely not fully priced into NVIDIA's stock.

*   **Snippet:** "New open model (gpt-oss-120B) is live on Cerebras running at a world record 3,000 tokens / sec, with high intelligence, low cost, and ease of migration – delivering the best of GenAI without compromises... INFERENCE AT 20X GPU SPEED. Powered by the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine – Cerebras Inference runs the latest AI models 20x faster than ChatGPT. Companies like Perplexity, Mistral, and Alpha Sense use Cerebras to get instant responses to user queries."
    *   **Date:** Undated (presented as current information, references May 28, 2025 news)
    *   **Source:** Cerebras.ai
    *   **Impact:** High. This snippet from Cerebras's official website, presented as current, reinforces their performance claims with a new model (gpt-oss-120B) at an even higher token rate (3,000 t/s). The explicit mention of "20x GPU speed" and specific customer names (Perplexity, Mistral, Alpha Sense) using their inference for "instant responses" indicates real-world production use and competitive displacement in critical, latency-sensitive applications.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While on their website, the specific performance numbers for gpt-oss-120B and the explicit customer mentions for inference speed are likely not widely disseminated or factored into NVIDIA's outlook.

*   **Snippet:** "Case Studies | Groq is fast inference for AI builders. Resources include: 'PGA of America: Transforming Operations with Faster, Smarter AI,' 'Enabling LLMOps with Fast AI Inference,' 'AI-powered Financial Insights,' 'Ideation and Animation at Human Speed,' 'Powering Inbound Call Success with AI,' 'Bringing AI-powered Robots to Everyone,' 'Real-time Inference for the Real World.' Groq LPU AI inference technology provides AI inference infrastructure that delivers exceptional compute speed, affordability, and energy efficiency."
    *   **Date:** Undated (implies current production usage)
    *   **Source:** Groq.com (Case Studies, Blog)
    *   **Impact:** Medium. While these snippets lack specific metrics or direct NVIDIA comparisons, the existence of multiple customer case studies across various industries (sports, finance, call centers, robotics) for "real-time inference" indicates Groq's technology is being deployed in production environments. This suggests a growing, albeit potentially niche, market presence for inference, which could chip away at NVIDIA's broader market share over time.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known within the niche communities following Groq, but potentially overlooked by the broader market focusing solely on NVIDIA's dominance. The specific customer names and use cases might not be widely recognized as direct threats to NVIDIA's overall revenue.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Direct Head-to-Head Comparisons:** While both Cerebras and Groq claim superior inference performance against GPUs, consistent, independent, and recent head-to-head benchmarks between Cerebras and Groq on the *exact same models and testing methodologies* are not readily available in the provided snippets. This makes a direct comparison of their relative strengths challenging.
*   **Scale of Displacement:** The snippets indicate customer adoption and impressive performance, but they do not quantify the scale of actual displacement of NVIDIA's hardware in terms of market share or revenue impact. These are still smaller players compared to NVIDIA's vast ecosystem.
*   **NVIDIA's Response:** The research does not include NVIDIA's direct response to these specific competitive claims or how they plan to counter these performance and cost advantages in the inference market.
*   **Training vs. Inference:** While the query asked about both training and inference, the overwhelming majority of recent, material, non-consensus information from Cerebras and Groq focuses on *inference* performance, suggesting this is where their primary competitive advantage currently lies. NVIDIA's dominance in large-scale AI model *training* appears less challenged by these specific recent findings.
