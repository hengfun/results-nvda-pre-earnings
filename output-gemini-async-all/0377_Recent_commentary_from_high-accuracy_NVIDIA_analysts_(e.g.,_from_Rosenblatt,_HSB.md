## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025, with analysts largely anticipating strong performance driven by its Data Center segment and the ongoing AI boom. While consensus estimates point to robust revenue and EPS growth, a deeper dive into recent analyst commentary reveals several material, non-consensus points that could significantly impact the stock's reaction.

Key expectations for Q2 FY2026 revenue generally hover between $45.8 billion and $46.4 billion, with non-GAAP EPS around $1.00 to $1.02. NVIDIA's own guidance for the quarter was approximately $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%, reflecting an estimated $8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue due to export control limitations. Gross margins are expected to recover to around 71.8% to 72.11%, with management targeting the mid-70% range later in the year.

However, several nuanced perspectives from analysts suggest potential areas of surprise or concern beyond these headline figures.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "HSBC analyst Frank Lee is cautious on Nvidia stock (NVDA) ahead of Q2 results, despite raising his price target to $200 from $125. Lee is concerned about the impact of China's efforts to reduce dependence on American chips and lower prices tied to US revenue-sharing rules on Nvidia's long-term growth. He expects Q2 and Q3 revenues to come in close to consensus, but does not expect these results to trigger big upward revisions due to ongoing China uncertainty. Lee maintains a Hold rating and advises investors to remain cautious."

    *   **Impact:** High. While the market is generally optimistic about the resumption of H20 chip sales to China, HSBC's specific concerns about China's long-term strategy (reducing dependence on US chips, potential pushback, and lower ASPs due to revenue sharing) present a significant non-consensus risk to future guidance and sustained growth in this critical market. This could temper enthusiasm even with a Q2 beat.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The general sentiment is positive regarding China re-entry, with some analysts estimating a potential $5-$10 billion upside from resumed H20 sales in the second half of the year. HSBC's "Hold" rating and explicit warning about China's long-term impact stand out against a backdrop of mostly "Buy" or "Strong Buy" ratings.

*   **Snippet:** "There are questions around the outlook for Nvidia's new solution, Blackwell, which claims to significantly reduce energy consumption and cost for customers, including concerns about the timing of Blackwell's growth and its total addressable market (TAM). This is reflected in the revenue estimates for the new B-series. Forecasts from 11 sources range from $7.3 billion to $34.0 billion in Q2, with consensus at $20.4 billion. This has triggered debate about the Data Center segment's future performance."
    *   **Date:** August 21, 2025
    *   **Source:** S&P Global, URL not available
    *   **Impact:** High. The extremely wide range in Blackwell (B-series) revenue forecasts for Q2 FY2026 ($7.3 billion to $34.0 billion) indicates significant uncertainty among analysts regarding the immediate ramp-up and adoption rate of NVIDIA's next-generation platform. A reported figure at either end of this wide range, or outside it, could lead to a substantial market reaction.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known but with high variability. While Blackwell is universally seen as a key growth driver, the lack of a tight consensus on its immediate revenue contribution makes it a non-consensus data point in terms of magnitude.

*   **Snippet:** "The consensus gross profit margin for the Data Center segment for FY 2026 continued to decrease, falling over 100bps to 74.1% from the 75.2% estimated at the end of last quarter. The figure stood at 78% in FY 2024 and FY 2025. The operating profit margin for FY 2026 and FY 2027 is also projected to move lower from 2024's 66.5%, due to the lower gross margin and higher expenses. These dynamics in consensus margins are causing the expected FY 2026 consensus P/E to be 40x and to range..."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. Despite NVIDIA's management targeting mid-70% gross margins later in the year, the observed *decrease* in the consensus gross profit margin for the Data Center segment for FY2026 (from 75.2% to 74.1%) due to higher Blackwell ramp costs suggests potential short-term margin pressure. If actual Q2 gross margins or Q3 guidance reflect this downward trend more acutely, it could disappoint investors focused on margin expansion.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While gross margins are a focus, the specific detail of a *decreasing* consensus for FY2026 Data Center gross margins, attributed to Blackwell ramp costs, might be overshadowed by the overall positive revenue narrative.

*   **Snippet:** "Wedbush analyst M. Bryson now expects that the computer hardware maker will post earnings of $0.93 per share for the quarter, up from their previous estimate of $0.92. Wedbush currently has a "Outperform" rating and a $210.00 target price on the stock."
    *   **Date:** August 25, 2025
    *   **Source:** MarketBeat, URL not available
    *   **Impact:** Low. Wedbush's Q2 FY2026 EPS estimate of $0.93 is slightly below the broader consensus of $1.00-$1.02. While a minor difference, it represents a slightly more conservative forecast from an otherwise bullish analyst. A beat on this lower estimate might not be as impactful as a beat on the higher consensus.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Slightly non-consensus. Most other recent analyst estimates for Q2 EPS are at or above $1.00.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **China Impact:** There's a clear contradiction between the general optimism about the resumption of H20 sales to China (with estimates of recovering an $8 billion loss or even adding $5-$10 billion upside) and HSBC's explicit caution regarding long-term geopolitical risks, potential lower ASPs due to revenue sharing, and China's push for domestic chips. The earnings call's commentary on China will be crucial to clarify this.
*   **Blackwell Ramp:** The wide range in Blackwell revenue estimates ($7.3 billion to $34.0 billion) indicates a significant gap in analyst understanding or visibility into the initial production and adoption rates. Management's commentary on Blackwell's ramp-up and demand trends will be a critical determinant of market reaction.
*   **Gross Margin Trajectory:** While management aims for mid-70% gross margins, the S&P Global report highlights a *decreasing* consensus for FY2026 Data Center gross margins due to Blackwell ramp costs. The Q2 reported gross margin and Q3 guidance will show whether these costs are a more significant headwind than widely expected.
