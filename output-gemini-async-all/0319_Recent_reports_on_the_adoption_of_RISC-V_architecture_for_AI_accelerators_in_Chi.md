## Analysis

## China's RISC-V Push and NVIDIA's Strategic Maneuvers Ahead of Earnings

**Shanghai, China – August 27, 2025** – As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, the landscape of AI accelerator adoption in China is undergoing significant shifts, driven by geopolitical tensions and a concerted push for technological self-sufficiency. Recent developments indicate a rapid acceleration in the adoption of RISC-V architecture for AI chips within China, alongside a notable response from NVIDIA itself. Material, non-consensus information suggests that while China is aggressively fostering its domestic RISC-V ecosystem, NVIDIA is also adapting its strategy to maintain its presence in the crucial Chinese market.

A key development impacting NVIDIA directly is the recent halt in production of its H20 AI chip, designed specifically for the Chinese market. This halt, triggered by Chinese regulatory scrutiny over alleged security risks and ongoing U.S. export controls, has reportedly led to a substantial $4.5 billion inventory writedown for NVIDIA. This event underscores the volatile nature of the Chinese market for foreign chipmakers and Beijing's intensified efforts to promote domestic alternatives.

In parallel, China is actively promoting RISC-V as a cornerstone of its domestic semiconductor strategy. Government bodies are drafting nationwide policies to boost RISC-V adoption across various industries, including AI and high-performance computing. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba are at the forefront of this movement, with Alibaba's Damo Academy launching server-grade RISC-V processors for AI acceleration. These efforts are positioning RISC-V as a cost-effective and geopolitically neutral alternative to proprietary architectures like x86 and Arm.

NVIDIA, in a strategic move to navigate this evolving environment, announced CUDA support for RISC-V at the RISC-V Summit China in July 2025. This move suggests NVIDIA is seeking to integrate its dominant software platform with the burgeoning RISC-V ecosystem, potentially allowing Chinese companies to leverage CUDA with domestically designed RISC-V CPUs, particularly for edge and embedded AI systems. This could be an attempt to maintain a foothold and influence within China's self-sufficient chip development.

The increasing adoption of RISC-V in China also poses a growing competitive threat to Arm Holdings, whose market share in China is reportedly facing headwinds due to the state-backed promotion of RISC-V. This broader shift in architectural preference within China could have long-term implications for the global semiconductor market.

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This snippet points to the practical adoption and perceived cost-effectiveness of RISC-V for AI workloads in China. The "cost advantages" and the ability to "offset costs by scaling deployments" suggest a compelling economic argument for Chinese businesses to choose domestic RISC-V solutions, even if they don't match NVIDIA's top-tier performance initially. This directly impacts NVIDIA's potential market share in China.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While cost is always a factor, specific examples of Chinese companies demonstrating efficient AI models on RISC-V and the explicit cost-benefit analysis against NVIDIA's performance might not be widely appreciated.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Performance vs. Adoption Rate:** While there's clear evidence of RISC-V adoption and development, the exact performance parity with NVIDIA's high-end AI accelerators for complex, large-scale AI training is not explicitly detailed. The DeepSeek example suggests efficiency, but a direct comparison of raw compute power for cutting-edge LLMs is less clear.
*   **NVIDIA's CUDA on RISC-V:** It's unclear how quickly NVIDIA's CUDA support for RISC-V will be adopted and if it will truly mitigate the impact of China's self-sufficiency drive or merely enable a new form of competition where NVIDIA provides the software layer but not necessarily the core hardware. The focus on "edge and embedded systems" for CUDA on RISC-V might indicate a strategic segmentation rather than a full embrace for data center AI.
*   **Quantifiable Impact:** While the $4.5 billion H20 writedown is a concrete figure, the broader financial impact of increasing RISC-V adoption on NVIDIA's future revenue and guidance from China is difficult to quantify precisely from these snippets. The rate at which Chinese domestic solutions will displace NVIDIA's offerings remains a key unknown.
