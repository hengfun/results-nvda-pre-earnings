## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to release its Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025, a review of recent developments concerning competing AI accelerators from AMD and Intel reveals several material, non-consensus insights that could influence NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance. While NVIDIA maintains a dominant position, major cloud providers are actively exploring and deploying alternatives, driven by factors such as cost-effectiveness, diversification, and improving software ecosystems from competitors.

The most significant developments point to AMD's MI350X/MI355X gaining substantial traction with hyperscalers, particularly Oracle Cloud and AWS, with broader availability expected in Q3 2025. Intel's Gaudi 3 has secured a foothold with IBM Cloud and offers aggressive pricing, but its overall market acceptance in the data center training segment appears to be less robust than initially anticipated, leading to a potential strategic shift for Intel. The improving software compatibility of AMD's ROCm with CUDA is also a critical factor that could erode NVIDIA's long-standing software moat.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure announced plans to scale to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, with zettascale clusters optimized for inference and training at unprecedented volumes."
    *   **Date:** 2025-06-17
    *   **Source:** At Its Advancing AI Event, AMD Reveals New GPUs, Software, and Systems - News, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGAcBB9sOj3vhfPczsvxnjngQqIl1gsvVXShZuqVnHN0j99GPMwQUDc5vDUXXtQnbIgUAzbSYJj_Q7lBiYHt7CUCRJcPOo8-BTq2t197fXFx7A_ZAjb6wxGrpt94xJBVuDBfecNO-J4Lnbr8lOEDt9AuHLuMzRFYuMkcvNOW3qVP8WBQBg8bYfwpFXjZosMsSsR4mzB6fHbd9_0LE2yU99_JSPW36U=]
    *   **Impact:** High. This represents a massive, specific commitment from a major hyperscaler to deploy AMD's latest AI accelerators at a scale that directly challenges NVIDIA's market share in both training and inference. The sheer volume of GPUs indicates a significant shift in procurement strategy and could divert substantial revenue from NVIDIA in future quarters.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While AMD's partnerships are known, the specific scale of Oracle's planned deployment (131,072 GPUs) is a very concrete and large number that might not be fully priced into NVIDIA's outlook.

*   **Snippet:** "AWS is planning to make a larger purchase of AMD GPUs for the first time."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-05
    *   **Source:** AMD's MI350 chips deliver big on memory but lag in networking against Nvidia, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEmQN1B9GtZHYk7Y8aC3kbZUt7l_Phkiiyhlm2CcfuJtU3wXXtYYvThTMCVr1ymVAaMmlt83ex-4MkOG_2onM-2f_Y7za-LDUagps5jzrR9istXphUKpCi6btMIdIGBn0QOPPlB9pS2yHoQXwDstNo7kzzMpNZMsLo4OnqWk2322w-8WezULhuMdXofsXL6frEClDakVYsGzo7w5JPNTfs=]
    *   **Impact:** High. As the leading cloud provider, AWS initiating a "larger purchase" of AMD GPUs for the first time signals a strategic move towards diversifying its AI hardware supply chain. This could lead to a significant long-term erosion of NVIDIA's market share within AWS, impacting future revenue streams.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While AWS has its own custom chips, a "larger purchase" of AMD GPUs for the first time indicates a more direct competitive threat to NVIDIA's core GPU business within AWS than previously emphasized.

*   **Snippet:** "Microsoft is ordering smaller quantities of the MI355, but is showing interest in the upcoming MI400." and "An Azure employee also emphasized AMD's recent kernel and compiler improvements: »I think from a platform perspective is the compiler and the kernel improvement. AMD's HIP programming model is coming very close to CUDA in terms of portability and syntax."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-05, 2025-08-22
    *   **Source:** AMD's MI350 chips deliver big on memory but lag in networking against Nvidia, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEmQN1B9GtZHYk7Y8aC3kbZUt7l_Phkiiyhlm2CcfuJtU3wXXtYYvThTMCVr1ymVAaMmlt83ex-4MkOG_2onM-2f_Y7za-LDUagps5jzrR9istXphUKpCi6btMIdIGBn0QOPPlB9pS2yHoQXwDstNo7kzzMpNZMsLo4OnqWk2322w-8WezULhuMdXofsXL6frEClDakVYsGzo7w5JPNTfs=]; AI compute: Nvidia's Grip and AMD's Chance - UncoverAlpha, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGD_-cG18GrL3zJuicH8sh_1GOaXEI__F4zg8dMB0pnDt8nO4DJZTazfjZFgRXcZwHmtRa9E5KwL2bnZDhBq-LYC-apH36zhOn7P146ppUsjaV-mbKyLTnNKOPE1pXFeSMvAdqt5_Y88H68qBfeRK75Ua8fGO_giUBIuQ==]
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High. While current MI355 orders are small, Azure's expressed interest in the MI400 series indicates a longer-term strategy to incorporate AMD's solutions. Crucially, the positive feedback from an Azure employee on ROCm's improving portability to CUDA directly addresses NVIDIA's key competitive advantage, suggesting that the software moat is becoming less impenetrable.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific commentary from an Azure employee on ROCm's improving software stack is a non-consensus detail that highlights a growing threat to NVIDIA's ecosystem lock-in.

*   **Snippet:** "We now see Gaudi3 offered via IBM Cloud, and Intel even launched its own AI cloud service using Gaudi3 hardware for select clients. To compete, Intel has been willing to price these accelerators very aggressively. For cloud pricing, Gaudi-based instances could come in well below the cost of Nvidia-based ones on a per-model-trained basis."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. IBM Cloud's adoption of Gaudi 3, combined with Intel's aggressive pricing, introduces a cost-effective alternative that directly pressures NVIDIA's pricing power. This could lead to margin compression for NVIDIA, especially for customers prioritizing cost over absolute performance or CUDA compatibility.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific impact on NVIDIA's pricing power and potential margin compression might be underestimated.

*   **Snippet:** "The MI350 series is available for order now and will see broader availability starting in Q3 2025." and "MI355 appears to offer a significant total cost of ownership (TCO) advantage over Nvidia's B200/ B300 series. Its all-in capital cost per chip is 45% lower than that of Nvidia's B200 HGX, primarily due to significantly lower chip pricing and lower transceiver and switch pricing"

    *   **Impact:** High. The broader availability of MI350 series in Q3 2025 means these competitive products are entering the market during or immediately after NVIDIA's current reporting period, directly impacting forward guidance. The substantial 45% lower capital cost per chip for MI355X compared to NVIDIA's B200/B300 is a compelling economic argument for cloud providers to diversify, potentially leading to reduced demand or pricing pressure for NVIDIA's offerings.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While AMD's competitive pricing is generally known, the specific 45% capital cost advantage and the Q3 2025 broad availability timeline provide concrete data points that may not be fully appreciated by the market.

*   **Snippet:** "With the acquisition of Habana Labs, Intel gained the Gaudi AI chip, aiming to gain traction in the AI training market. However, it has since released Gaudi-3 to less-than-expected market acceptance. As a result of the ongoing restructuring, Intel seems to be focusing on three major areas: Edge AI... Agentic AI... [and] focusing away from standalone AI accelerators."

    *   **Source:** Intel Officially Throws in Training Towel, Will Focus on Edge and Agentic AI - HPCwire, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGHCRhn0G9OAKls_ckzd9MyXS0VpMOB9F-TFS3b6nDFFPnY35HgcpatY_3fnyVdmSqb-K-J30exgs6VEcaKmXcM5g1sl48pjN3EuCjs5sY0t29l93_ycN8UfZ6FbxFlpwounvMymI2TxtEVZQDUCGlHRdsn2qojHpXa4y4X7pXjLyJsjwiTTeGj7MO4rJu20EJCcdegzyyd6RfutQz7038LFBi8rE-LMn7WIw==]
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Intel's Gaudi 3's "less-than-expected market acceptance" and a strategic shift away from standalone AI accelerators for data center training suggest that Intel is not posing a significant immediate threat to NVIDIA in this core segment. This could be a positive for NVIDIA, as it reduces the number of strong direct competitors in the hyperscale training market.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Intel's struggles in AI are generally known, the explicit statement about "less-than-expected market acceptance" for Gaudi 3 and the strategic pivot away from standalone AI accelerators for training are specific details that could be a non-consensus positive for NVIDIA.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **AMD MI350 Availability Nuance:** While multiple sources confirm "broader availability starting in Q3 2025" for AMD's MI350 series, some indicate that "shipments have just started" or that initial shipments to specific cloud providers like TensorWave occurred "last week". This suggests that while the chips are technically available, the ramp-up to widespread deployment across major hyperscalers might still be in its early stages within Q3, rather than a full-scale rollout. This nuance could affect the immediate impact on NVIDIA's Q2 earnings (which ended July 2025) but is highly relevant for Q3 and forward guidance.
*   **AMD MI350 Pricing:** There's a "rumored 70% price jump for its Instinct MI350 AI chips - from $15,000 to around $25,000". However, even at $25,000, the MI350X is still positioned as "significantly more expensive" than NVIDIA's Blackwell-based chips and offers a "45% lower" capital cost per chip compared to NVIDIA's B200/B300. This suggests that while AMD might be increasing its pricing, it still aims to maintain a significant cost advantage over NVIDIA. The market's reaction to this rumored price increase, if confirmed, will be important.
*   **Intel Gaudi 3 Adoption vs. Strategic Shift:** Despite IBM Cloud offering Gaudi 3 and AWS having Gaudi-based instances, Intel's overall "less-than-expected market acceptance" and a strategic shift away from standalone AI accelerators present a mixed picture. This indicates that while some cloud providers are adopting Gaudi 3, it hasn't achieved the widespread traction Intel desired in the core AI training market, leading them to re-evaluate their strategy. This implies that Intel's direct competitive threat to NVIDIA in hyperscale training may be diminishing.
