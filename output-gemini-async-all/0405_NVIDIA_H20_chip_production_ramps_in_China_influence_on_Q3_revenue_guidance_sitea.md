## Analysis

The search query targeting `site:asia.nikkei.com` for August 2025 did not yield any results. Therefore, the following analysis is based on information from other reputable financial news sources published within the last three months, which directly address the impact of NVIDIA's H20 chip production and China sales on its Q3 revenue guidance.

NVIDIA is reporting its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025. The influence of its H20 chip production and sales in China on its Q3 FY2026 revenue guidance is a critical, non-consensus factor that could materially impact the company's outlook. Recent developments indicate a complex and evolving situation, with significant financial implications and divergent analyst expectations.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's operations in China, particularly concerning its H20 AI chip, have been a significant point of uncertainty leading into its Q2 FY2026 earnings report and Q3 guidance. Initially, the imposition of U.S. export license requirements on H20 products in April 2025 led to a halt in production and substantial financial setbacks. NVIDIA reported a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 FY2026 due to excess H20 inventory and purchase obligations, and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion in H20 revenue that quarter. The company's Q2 FY2026 outlook already factored in an estimated $8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue due to these limitations.

However, a recent development in mid-July 2025 saw the U.S. government reportedly greenlight the resumption of H20 AI chip exports to China. While this could partially restore lost revenue, it comes with a new condition: NVIDIA must share 15% of these revenues with the U.S. government. This partial lifting of the ban, coupled with the potential for backlogged orders from major Chinese tech firms, could provide an upside to Q3 revenue, but the 15% revenue cut will impact margins.

Adding another layer of complexity, there are reports that Beijing has discouraged the use of the H20 chip due to cybersecurity concerns, leading to a halt in H20 production by NVIDIA. In response, NVIDIA is reportedly developing a new Blackwell-based chip, tentatively named B30A, specifically for the Chinese market. This chip is expected to surpass H20's performance while adhering to U.S. export regulations and could offer up to 10x the AI training efficiency of the H20. While the B30A could be a long-term solution, its immediate impact on Q3 guidance is uncertain, and its success hinges on securing U.S. export licenses and overcoming any lingering Chinese government concerns.

Analyst expectations for China's contribution to Q3 revenue guidance are widely divergent, highlighting the non-consensus nature of this information. Some analysts, like UBS's Timothy Arcuri, project Q3 revenue guidance of $54-55 billion *excluding* China, but potentially $57 billion *if China is included*. In contrast, KeyBanc's John Vinh estimates an incremental $2-3 billion in revenue if China is factored into guidance. More conservatively, Wedbush Securities anticipates only $1-1.5 billion in incremental quarterly revenue from China this year, significantly below NVIDIA's earlier expectations. This wide range underscores the uncertainty surrounding the actual impact of China sales on NVIDIA's forward-looking statements.

### Structured Findings:

**1. Snippet: H20 Production Halt and Significant Revenue Loss**
*   **Snippet:** "On April 9, 2025, NVIDIA was informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. ... This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026 (Official Press Release)
*   **Impact:** **High** - This is a direct, material financial impact on Q1 and Q2, setting the baseline for the China revenue problem. The $8 billion loss in Q2 revenue guidance is substantial and directly impacts the upcoming report.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that H20 sales were impacted, but the specific financial charge ($4.5B) and projected Q2 revenue loss ($8.0B) are critical details that might not be fully priced into all models, especially regarding the carry-over effect into Q3 guidance.

**2. Snippet: U.S. Greenlights H20 Exports to China with 15% Revenue Cut & China Cybersecurity Concerns**
*   **Snippet:** "The chip giant has received a green light from the U.S. government to resume exports of its advanced H20 AI chips to China, according to multiple sources including Reuters, and the Financial Times. ... The ban has since been lifted in exchange for Nvidia sharing 15% of revenues with the US government, but the picture has since been complicated further. “There are reports that Nvidia is halting production of those chip sets as the Chinese government has concerns about cybersecurity,” says Sekera. “If that report is correct, then we're going to want to hear a lot more detail from Nvidia as they're reportedly about to introduce a newer chip, the B30A, that is intended to replace the H20.”"
*   **Date:** July 16, 2025 (for greenlight), August 27, 2025 (for cybersecurity concerns)
*   **Source:** The Economic Times, MoneyWeek
*   **Impact:** **High** - The resumption of H20 sales could provide an upside to Q3 revenue guidance, but the 15% revenue cut is a new, material cost. The reported halt in H20 production due to China's cybersecurity concerns introduces significant uncertainty and could negate the positive impact of the U.S. greenlight, making the B30A even more critical.
*   **Consensus Check:** The greenlight for H20 exports might be known, but the 15% revenue cut and especially the *new reports of China's cybersecurity concerns leading to a production halt* are likely non-consensus and could surprise the market.

**3. Snippet: Divergent Analyst Expectations for China's Q3 Revenue Contribution**
*   **Snippet:** "For Nvidia's fiscal Q2 print, Arcuri is expecting revenue in the $46 billion range and is anticipating the company to guide for fiscal Q3 revenue of $54 billion to $55 billion, excluding China. If China is included, the forecast could be for $57 billion in revenue. ... “If (NVIDIA) were to include China in its guidance, we believe it would contribute an incremental US$2–3 billion in revenue,” noted KeyBanc analyst John Vinh. ... “Our adjusted NVDA numbers anticipate only about $1 billion - $1.5 billion in quarterly incremental revenue this year from China,” said Matt Bryson, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities. Bryson anticipates that China revenue will then ramp up in 2026, but that for now the numbers will be “well below the $8B NVDA believed it would have generated in Q2”."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025 (UBS, Wedbush), August 22, 2025 (KeyBanc)
*   **Source:** Kiplinger, Nasdaq, MoneyWeek
*   **Impact:** **High** - The wide range of expectations for China's revenue contribution to Q3 guidance (from $1-1.5 billion to potentially $2-3 billion, or even up to $57 billion if fully included) indicates a significant non-consensus view that will directly impact how investors interpret NVIDIA's guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is explicitly non-consensus. The market is clearly divided on how much China revenue will contribute to Q3, making any specific guidance from NVIDIA highly material.

**4. Snippet: Development of New Blackwell-based B30A Chip for China**
*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is quietly preparing a new artificial intelligence chip for China that would surpass the performance of its current H20 model, even as US regulators weigh how much access Chinese companies should have to cutting-edge American technology. Two people briefed on the matter told Reuters that the chip, tentatively called the B30A, is based on NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture and is expected to deliver roughly half the computing power of the company's flagship dual-die B300 accelerator card. ... The B30A, Nvidia's Blackwell-based successor to the H20, could bridge this gap if it secures U.S. export licenses. Its potential to outperform the H20 by 10x in AI training efficiency makes it a critical pivot point."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025 (Nasdaq), August 26, 2025 (Nvidia's China Dilemma)
*   **Source:** Nasdaq, Nvidia's China Dilemma (Seeking Alpha)
*   **Impact:** **Medium** - While the B30A is a forward-looking development, any commentary from NVIDIA on its progress, expected launch, and potential revenue contribution could significantly influence investor sentiment and future guidance. It's a strategic response to the H20 challenges.
*   **Consensus Check:** The existence of a new China-specific chip (B30A) is likely known to some, but the specific details about its performance relative to H20, its Blackwell architecture, and the timeline for securing export licenses are less clear and could be considered non-consensus, especially regarding its potential to quickly offset H20 losses.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **H20 Status:** There's a contradiction regarding the H20. While the U.S. reportedly greenlit exports in July, reports from August suggest NVIDIA halted H20 production due to China's cybersecurity concerns. This creates significant ambiguity about whether any H20 revenue will actually materialize in Q3.
*   **China Revenue Contribution:** The wide disparity in analyst estimates for China's Q3 revenue contribution (from $1-1.5 billion to $2-3 billion, or even up to $57 billion if fully included in a $54-55B ex-China guidance) highlights a major gap in consensus. NVIDIA's actual guidance will be crucial here.
*   **B30A Timeline and Approval:** While the B30A is in development, the timeline for its U.S. export license approval and its market availability in China remains a significant unknown, impacting its ability to quickly fill the revenue void left by H20.
