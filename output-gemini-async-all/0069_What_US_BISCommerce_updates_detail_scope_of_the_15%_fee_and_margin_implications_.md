## Analysis

Here are the findings regarding the US BIS/Commerce updates on the 15% fee and its margin implications for NVIDIA's China shipments, filtered for content published within the last three months:

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report for Q2 FY2026 will be significantly influenced by the recently implemented 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the US government for sales of its H20 AI chips to China. This unprecedented "pay-to-export" model, negotiated between the Trump administration and NVIDIA, allows the company to resume shipments after an earlier ban. While the resumption of sales unlocks a substantial market opportunity, the 15% levy on *gross revenue* directly impacts profitability. Analysts estimate this could reduce NVIDIA's overall gross margins by approximately one percentage point.

In response, NVIDIA is reportedly considering an 18% price hike on its H20 chips to offset the fee and maintain profit dollars. However, this strategy faces a significant non-consensus headwind: the Chinese government has reportedly urged domestic companies, particularly for government-related projects, to avoid using NVIDIA's H20 chips due to alleged security vulnerabilities. This pushback from Beijing could undermine NVIDIA's pricing power and dampen the expected demand, making the full revenue recovery and margin preservation more challenging than initially anticipated. The interplay between the US fee, NVIDIA's pricing strategy, and China's resistance will be a critical factor in the company's performance and forward-looking guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "AMD has secured U.S. government approval to resume shipments of its China-compliant AI accelerators, joining Nvidia in a newly structured licensing regime that imposes a 15% fee on related sales. The Commerce Department started granting these licenses on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter, with AMD's MI308 chip identified as one of the eligible products under the arrangement. The MI308 is a performance-constrained variant designed to meet tightened U.S. export controls, mirroring Nvidia's approach with its H20 chip. While Nvidia publicly acknowledged the framework, AMD has not yet commented on the specifics, though multiple reports confirm its inclusion. The fee—unprecedented in U.S. export control practice—effectively acts as a revenue-sharing mechanism, allowing both companies to tap into China's vast AI market while adhering to national security restrictions."

- **Impact:** High. This confirms the 15% fee and its application to NVIDIA's H20 chips, directly impacting revenue and margins from China sales. The "unprecedented" nature highlights its novelty and potential for ongoing scrutiny.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known that a fee exists, but the specific details of it being a "revenue-sharing mechanism" and its direct application to H20 sales are crucial for understanding the financial impact.

- **Snippet:** "The financial implications are severe. The 15% levy is applied to gross revenue, not profit, which will cause a significant and direct compression of margins in what has historically been a critical market. In fiscal year 2024, China accounted for 13% of Nvidia's total revenue and 24% of AMD's, underscoring the high stakes involved. While the deal allows the companies to salvage some portion of these sales, the profitability of that revenue is now permanently impaired."

- **Impact:** High. Clarifies that the 15% is on *gross revenue*, which is a more severe impact than on net profit. This directly translates to lower gross margins on China-bound H20 sales. The mention of China's revenue contribution in FY2024 provides context for the scale of the impact.
- **Consensus Check:** The distinction between gross revenue and profit impact is a critical detail that might be overlooked by general market commentary, making it non-consensus.

- **Snippet:** "To offset the impact, NVIDIA is said to be preparing an up to 18% price hike on its H20 AI chips, according to Wccftech. An analyst cited in the report noted that NVIDIA intends to pass the cost of its deal with President Trump on to Chinese customers. If the H20 price hike is implemented, it will likely compress gross profit margins, though overall profitability in the region is expected to remain steady, the report adds."

- **Impact:** Medium. This reveals NVIDIA's potential strategy to mitigate the margin hit. If successful, it could partially offset the 15% fee. However, its success is contingent on market acceptance and Chinese government reaction.
- **Consensus Check:** This specific potential price hike is likely non-consensus, as it's a forward-looking strategic move reported by niche industry sources.

- **Snippet:** "According to this Bloomberg report, shortly after the export license was resumed, Beijing “has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips, especially for government-related purposes.” I also expect such discouragement to complicate Nvidia's market potential in the commercial sector in China, as many of the megatech firms derive significant profits from government-related projects. Also, it's also possible that larger customers in Chinese, such ... To start, as part of the export license, the U.S. government requires Nvidia to pay 15% of its revenue from these sales directly to the U.S. Treasury. This revenue-sharing model effectively acts as a direct reduction in the top line, leading to an immediate and substantial hit to the gross margin on every H20 chip sold in that market. Furthermore, the H20 itself is a less-powerful, downgraded version of Nvidia's flagship GPUs, designed to comply with U.S. export controls. Combined with the Chinese government's discouragement for these chips, I foresee little pricing power for Nvidia."

- **Impact:** High. This introduces a significant counter-narrative to the positive impact of resumed sales. Chinese government discouragement directly threatens demand and NVIDIA's ability to implement price hikes, potentially leading to lower-than-expected revenue and margin compression from the China market.
- **Consensus Check:** While some market participants might be aware of US-China tensions, the specific and active "urging" by Beijing to avoid H20 chips, especially for government use, is a non-consensus detail that could significantly impact actual sales volumes and pricing power.

- **Snippet:** "NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 27, 2025, of $44.1 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 69% from a year ago. On April 9, 2025, NVIDIA was informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61.0%, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3%."

- **Impact:** High. While this is Q1 earnings, it provides crucial historical context for the *magnitude* of margin impact from H20 export restrictions. The difference between reported gross margin (60.5-61.0%) and what it would have been without the charge (71.3%) demonstrates the sensitivity of NVIDIA's margins to China-related policy. This sets a baseline for understanding the ongoing impact of the 15% fee.
- **Consensus Check:** The Q1 earnings results are known, but the specific breakdown of the $4.5 billion charge and its direct impact on gross margin, providing a clear illustration of the financial sensitivity to China export policies, serves as a strong, material data point for the current situation.
