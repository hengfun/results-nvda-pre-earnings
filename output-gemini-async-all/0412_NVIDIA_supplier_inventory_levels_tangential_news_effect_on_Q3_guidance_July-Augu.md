## Analysis

As a pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), my objective is to identify material, non-consensus information that could significantly impact the company's Q2 FY2026 earnings report (ending July 2025) or forward-looking Q3 guidance. NVIDIA is reporting earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025.

My research focused on NVIDIA's supplier inventory levels and tangential news affecting Q3 guidance for July-August 2025, with a strict filter for content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is heading into its Q2 FY2026 earnings report with high expectations, largely driven by insatiable demand for its AI chips and a strong product roadmap, including the Blackwell platform. However, several nuanced supply chain and geopolitical factors present potential non-consensus risks and opportunities that could influence Q3 guidance.

A significant, and potentially overlooked, development is the recent halt in production of NVIDIA's China-specific H20 chips. While the U.S. government had recently granted licenses for H20 sales to China, reports from late August 2025 indicate that NVIDIA has instructed suppliers like Samsung and Amkor to suspend H20 component production due to Beijing's security concerns. This creates considerable uncertainty around China revenue, which some analysts may still be factoring into their Q3 guidance, potentially leading to a downward revision if the situation persists or worsens. The company is reportedly developing a new Blackwell-based chip (B30) for China, but its immediate impact on Q3 is unclear.

On the supply side, while demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips is robust and 2025 production is reportedly sold out, persistent bottlenecks at TSMC for CoWoS advanced packaging remain a critical constraint. Despite TSMC's efforts to double CoWoS capacity, reports suggest it's still insufficient to meet overall demand. This ongoing limitation could cap NVIDIA's ability to fully capitalize on demand, potentially leading to conservative guidance even amid strong underlying interest.

Regarding High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a crucial component for NVIDIA's GPUs, SK Hynix and Micron Technology appear to be in strong positions, with their 2025 HBM output largely sold out and Micron actively shipping HBM3E for Blackwell Ultra. Conversely, Samsung, a major memory player, is reportedly still in the qualification stage for HBM3E with NVIDIA's latest chips, which could limit NVIDIA's HBM supply diversification in the near term. This dynamic could place more pressure on SK Hynix and Micron to scale, and any issues with their ramp-up could have a magnified impact on NVIDIA's ability to ship. The halt in H20 production also directly impacts Samsung, as it was a key HBM3 supplier for that specific chip.

Overall, while the market anticipates a strong "beat and raise" from NVIDIA, the complexities surrounding China sales, persistent CoWoS packaging constraints, and the specific HBM supplier dynamics (particularly Samsung's lagging qualification for newer HBM generations) represent material, non-consensus factors that could introduce volatility or lead to more cautious forward guidance than widely expected.

**Structured Findings:**

**1. Finding: Halt in NVIDIA H20 Chip Production for China**
- **Snippet:** "Nvidia has halted production of components for its H20 AI chipset, designed exclusively for China, due to China's export restrictions. ... On Aug. 21 (local time), The Information reported that Nvidia has instructed Samsung Electronics and Amkor to halt production related to H20. Samsung Electronics supplies high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for H20."

- **Impact:** High. This is a very recent development that directly contradicts the earlier news of H20 sales resumption. If analysts have factored in H20 revenue for Q3 based on the July approval, this halt could lead to a significant miss on China-related revenue expectations and potentially a more conservative Q3 guidance. The previous $4.5 billion charge related to H20 inventory in Q1 FY2026 highlights the financial sensitivity to these restrictions.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the initial resumption of H20 sales was widely reported, the subsequent halt due to China's security concerns is very recent and may not be fully priced into all analyst models, especially those with "a lot of Chinese revenues baked into that" Q3 guidance.

**2. Finding: Persistent TSMC CoWoS Packaging Bottlenecks**
- **Snippet:** "TSMC, the sole foundry for advanced AI chips, has confirmed production bottlenecks will persist through 2025. Its CoWoS packaging technology, essential for heterogeneous integration in AI chips, is scaling from 35,000 to 70,000 wafers per month by 2025. Yet, even with this growth, wafer availability and advanced node capacity (5nm and below) remain insufficient to meet demand."

- **Source:** AInvest, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFeKR6fLbUH95ODOmRZ5O07fZeyW2VKIO8zr5yVPgjrwPhOkHGH0dFf4D3_0RVSTqqQhRxyYtRgqnEQhI_Ic_O0hKSDHLZa31MF2nm8bHKQwoMSWOBzPoOzLrH97OesXisHdT5FvKliiVJJ3nCfG5ajPQgM_3DKGRvrqPXIRDBLUxHGax3O-mlUaxqRmAUJ663-vgo8pXI0wieGwhQj7V6up3vnfupx_1J92A5TVSN3CPBxywEMlcAgj9n3vhA
- **Impact:** High. Despite strong demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips and TSMC's increased capacity, the explicit statement that capacity remains "insufficient to meet demand" suggests an ongoing supply constraint. This could limit NVIDIA's ability to fully capture the booming AI chip market, potentially leading to a more conservative Q3 guidance than some bullish estimates.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known but potentially underestimated in its persistence. While supply constraints have been a recurring theme, the continued "insufficient" capacity despite doubling efforts could be a more significant headwind than generally acknowledged, especially for the Blackwell ramp.

**3. Finding: Samsung's HBM3E Qualification Status for NVIDIA's Latest Chips**
- **Snippet:** "Samsung supplies HBM3E to AMD and Broadcom but has yet to break into the supply chain of Nvidia, the dominant AI chipmaker. ... Samsung is still in the product qualification stage." "Although Micron holds only 5.1% of the global HBM market—compared to SK hynix's 52.5% and Samsung's 42.4%—its entry into Nvidia's supply chain is expected to strengthen its position. ... Samsung is still in the product qualification stage."

- **Impact:** Medium. While SK Hynix and Micron are strong HBM3E suppliers for NVIDIA and have sold out 2025 capacity, Samsung's delayed qualification for NVIDIA's latest chips could limit NVIDIA's flexibility and potentially constrain its ability to scale HBM supply if demand outstrips the combined capacity of SK Hynix and Micron. This could impact the speed of the Blackwell ramp.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market generally focuses on overall HBM demand and supply, but the specific supplier dynamics and Samsung's lagging qualification for NVIDIA's newest platforms could be a subtle but important factor in NVIDIA's ability to meet future demand.

**4. Finding: Micron's HBM Output for 2025 Sold Out, Strong Demand into 2026**
- **Snippet:** "Micron's entire HBM supply for 2025 is sold out amid strong AI-driven demand. ... Micron is a key supplier for Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 and AMD' Instinct MI350 GPUs, which require massive memory bandwidth. ... Notably, Micron has sold out its HBM output for 2025 and is seeing strong demand into 2026, with the scarcity boosting its margins."

- **Impact:** Medium. This confirms strong demand for NVIDIA's products and a secure HBM supply from Micron for 2025. It suggests that NVIDIA's ability to meet demand for its Blackwell chips is supported by key HBM suppliers. However, the "sold out" status also implies limited upside flexibility if demand further accelerates beyond current projections.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The strong demand for HBM and its impact on suppliers like Micron is a well-established narrative in the AI chip market.
