## Analysis

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report will likely be significantly influenced by the accelerating shift in networking fabric preferences within AI data centers, with strong evidence pointing towards a growing adoption of its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform over traditional InfiniBand for certain large-scale AI workloads. While specific lead times for Quantum-3/4 InfiniBand switches were not explicitly found in recent reports, the available information suggests a robust and expanding demand for NVIDIA's Ethernet solutions, potentially indicating a mix shift that could impact revenue composition and forward-looking guidance.

A key non-consensus insight suggests that NVIDIA's Spectrum-X Ethernet is "out shipping" its Quantum InfiniBand by a significant margin with the Blackwell generation, signaling a more rapid transition than widely perceived. Market research firm Dell'Oro Group projects that Ethernet switch ASIC sales will surpass InfiniBand in 2025 and continue to dominate by 2030, reinforcing the long-term trend. NVIDIA's recent introduction of Spectrum-XGS further solidifies its Ethernet strategy, enabling "scale-across" networking for geographically dispersed data centers, a move seen as directly competitive with offerings from rivals like Broadcom.

Despite the strong momentum in Ethernet, NVIDIA continues to advance its InfiniBand offerings, with the Quantum-X800 InfiniBand switches featuring co-packaged optics and offering ultra-low latency for the most demanding HPC and AI supercomputing environments. One recent listing for a Quantum-X800 switch showed an estimated delivery within weeks, suggesting availability for its latest InfiniBand technology. However, the absence of specific lead times for Quantum-3/4 InfiniBand remains a notable information gap.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**1. Evidence of Spectrum-X Ethernet Outshipping Quantum InfiniBand**

*   **Snippet:** "Even Nvidia recognizes the dominance of Ethernet and with the Blackwell generation, Spectrum-X Ethernet is out shipping their Quantum InfiniBand by a large amount."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-11
*   **Source:** The New AI Networks | Ultra Ethernet UEC | UALink vs Broadcom Scale Up Ethernet SUE - AInvest (via SemiAnalysis)
*   **Impact:** High. This directly indicates a significant fabric mix shift towards Spectrum-X Ethernet, potentially impacting InfiniBand revenue growth or market share in the near term. If true, this is a material, non-consensus data point that could surprise some investors.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While the growth of Spectrum-X is known, a direct claim of "out shipping by a large amount" for the Blackwell generation is a strong statement that may not be fully priced into consensus expectations.

---

**2. Strong Annualized Revenue and Adoption for Spectrum-X Ethernet**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's Ethernet networking platform, Spectrum-X, is also expanding quickly. It is now on pace to generate more than $8 billion in annualized revenues. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle and Google Cloud are already deploying it to handle AI network traffic with low latency and high utilization."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-15 (Nasdaq, Barchart.com)
*   **Source:** Can NVIDIA's End-to-End Stack Keep Driving Networking Revenues? | Nasdaq; Can NVIDIA's End-To-End Stack Keep Driving Networking Revenues? - Barchart.com
*   **Impact:** High. The $8 billion annualized revenue run rate for Spectrum-X, coupled with adoption by major hyperscalers, demonstrates significant and accelerating demand for NVIDIA's Ethernet solutions. This will be a key driver for networking revenue.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific annualized revenue figure and continued customer wins reinforce the strong momentum. The breadth of hyperscaler adoption is a strong validation.

**3. Market Projection: Ethernet to Overtake InfiniBand in Switch ASIC Sales**

*   **Snippet:** "Traditional HPC networks like InfiniBand, once the gold standard for low-latency performance, are being challenged by Spectrum-XGS's Ethernet-based approach. ... According to the Dell'Oro Group, Ethernet switch ASIC sales are projected to overtake InfiniBand in 2025 and dominate by 2030, with a 32% compound annual growth rate (CAGR)."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-22, 2025-08-23
*   **Source:** Nvidia's Spectrum-XGS Ethernet and the Future of AI Infrastructure: How 'Scale-Across' Networking is Reshaping Hyperscale Economics and Unlocking New Investment Opportunities - AInvest; Nvidia's Spectrum-XGS and the Emergence of Giga-Scale AI Factories - AInvest
*   **Impact:** High. This is a clear, third-party market projection indicating a fundamental shift in the networking landscape for AI. The timing (overtaking in 2025) is particularly relevant for near-term guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Increasingly known, but the specific Dell'Oro projection and its implications for NVIDIA's product mix might still be underappreciated by some investors focused solely on InfiniBand's historical dominance.

**4. Introduction of Spectrum-XGS Ethernet for "Scale-Across" AI Super-Factories**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia on Friday unveiled an upgraded version of its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform – called Spectrum-XGS – designed to enable AI demand to be shared across multiple data centers. ... Spectrum-XGS is aimed squarely at the shift to Ethernet, importing more of InfiniBand's toolsets into the more popular Ethernet world."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-22 (Fierce Network), 2025-08-26 (Techstrong IT)
*   **Source:** Nvidia beefs up its Ethernet platform to let data centers join forces - Fierce Network; NVIDIA Debuts Spectrum-XGS Ethernet to Link Distributed Data Centers - Techstrong IT
*   **Impact:** High. The launch of Spectrum-XGS, just ahead of earnings, demonstrates NVIDIA's aggressive push into advanced Ethernet solutions for distributed AI. This expands the addressable market for Ethernet and further blurs the lines between InfiniBand and Ethernet capabilities for AI. It also positions NVIDIA as a direct competitor to Broadcom in this space.
*   **Consensus Check:** Newly announced, so the full implications and market reception are likely not yet fully integrated into consensus. The "scale-across" capability is a new dimension for NVIDIA's Ethernet offerings.

**5. Quantum-X800 InfiniBand Switch Estimated Delivery**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA Quantum-X800 Q3200-RA InfiniBand Switch – 2U, Dual 36-Port 800Gb/s XDR, Air-Cooled, OSFP, UFM-Managed. MFG.PART: Quantum-X800-Q3200-RA. Estimated Delivery By Fri, Sep 12 - Tue, Sep 18. If ordered within 24 hrs."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-24 (Uvation Marketplace listing date, delivery estimate is for early September 2025)
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Quantum-X800 Q3200-RA InfiniBand Switch – 2U, Dual 36-Port 800Gb/s, Air-Cooled - Uvation Marketplace
*   **Impact:** Medium. While this is for the next-generation Quantum-X800, not Quantum-3/4, the short estimated delivery time for a high-end InfiniBand product suggests that NVIDIA is actively shipping its latest InfiniBand technology. It implies that supply for its cutting-edge InfiniBand is available, though it doesn't directly address lead times for older generations.
*   **Consensus Check:** Specific product availability and lead times are often niche information. This indicates that the latest InfiniBand is available for purchase with relatively short delivery.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Quantum-3/4 Lead Times:** A significant gap in the research is the lack of explicit lead time information for NVIDIA's Quantum-3 and Quantum-4 InfiniBand switches. The available lead time is for the newer Quantum-X800. This makes it difficult to directly assess the demand and supply dynamics for the specific older generations requested in the query.
*   **"Outshipping" Claim vs. InfiniBand's Continued Role:** While one source claims Spectrum-X is "out shipping" Quantum InfiniBand by a large amount, other NVIDIA communications emphasize InfiniBand's continued role as the "gold standard" for the most demanding HPC and AI supercomputers. This creates a nuanced picture where both fabrics are growing, but with a clear shift in momentum towards Ethernet for broader AI deployments. The extent of the "outshipping" needs further validation.
