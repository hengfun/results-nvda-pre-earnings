## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the demand for NVIDIA's networking solutions (InfiniBand, Spectrum-X) in AI data centers, focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY22026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's networking business, encompassing both its traditional InfiniBand and its newer Spectrum-X Ethernet solutions, is a critical component of its full-stack AI infrastructure strategy and a significant growth driver for its Data Center segment. Recent reports indicate a robust, and potentially accelerating, demand for these networking products. In Q1 FY2026, NVIDIA's networking revenues saw a substantial 64% sequential jump to $5 billion, driven by strong adoption of NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X. This momentum is expected to continue into Q2 FY2026, with some analysts anticipating another "standout quarter" for networking.

A key development is NVIDIA's recent introduction of Spectrum-XGS Ethernet (August 22, 2025), a "scale-across" technology designed to interconnect distributed data centers into "giga-scale AI super-factories." This innovation directly addresses the growing capacity constraints of individual data centers and positions NVIDIA to capitalize on the trend of geographically dispersed AI computing. Early adoption by AI infrastructure specialist CoreWeave underscores the immediate relevance and demand for this new offering.

However, the competitive landscape in AI networking is evolving rapidly. While InfiniBand has historically dominated high-performance AI back-end networks (holding over 80% share in late 2023), a recent Dell'Oro Group report (July 15, 2025) suggests that Ethernet is "winning the war" and is "firmly positioned to overtake InfiniBand" in these deployments as the industry moves to 800 Gbps and beyond. This report also highlights that while NVIDIA, Celestica, and Huawei led the Ethernet segment in 2024, "significant share shifts" are anticipated in 2025 as large-scale Ethernet deployments by major hyperscalers ramp up, creating opportunities for other vendors like Arista, Cisco, and Juniper/HPE to gain traction. This indicates a potential increase in competition for NVIDIA in the rapidly expanding Ethernet AI networking market, even as its own Spectrum-X platform continues to innovate and gain traction. The market will be closely watching for commentary on the relative growth of InfiniBand versus Spectrum-X and the competitive dynamics in the Ethernet space during the earnings call.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Last quarter's ER showed an uptick in growth from a different part of Nvidia's data center end market—networking. In Q1, Nvidia's networking revenues jumped by a massive 64% sequentially to $5B, with demand for the company's NVLink, Infiniband, and SpectrumX products driving those gains in the networking segment. The Q1 performance of Nvidia's networking business was the overlooked revelation for me, and my checks indicate that Q2 is going to be another standout quarter for Nvidia's networking business."

    *   **Impact:** Low. This is a general statement about NVIDIA's strong position and overall Data Center outlook, which is widely known and reflected in consensus estimates. It provides context but lacks specific non-consensus details about networking.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The Dell'Oro report strongly indicates a rapid shift from InfiniBand to Ethernet in AI back-end networks, with Ethernet "winning the war". However, other sources, including NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 results, show continued strong demand for *both* InfiniBand and Spectrum-X. This suggests that while the market is shifting, InfiniBand still holds significant value for certain high-performance deployments, and NVIDIA is well-positioned with both offerings. The key will be the *rate* of this shift and NVIDIA's ability to maintain or grow market share in the increasingly competitive Ethernet space.
*   **Gap:** While there's an expectation of a "standout quarter" for networking in Q2 FY2026, specific quantitative guidance or analyst estimates for NVIDIA's networking revenue for the current quarter are not publicly available. The Dell'Oro report provides market-wide trends but not NVIDIA-specific breakdowns for the immediate future. More granular data on the revenue split and growth rates between InfiniBand and Spectrum-X within NVIDIA's networking segment would be highly material.
