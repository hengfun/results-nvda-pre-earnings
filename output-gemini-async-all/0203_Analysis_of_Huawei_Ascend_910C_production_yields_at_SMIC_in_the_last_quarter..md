## Analysis

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report (for the quarter ending July 2025) could be materially impacted by recent, non-consensus information regarding Huawei's Ascend 910C AI chip production at SMIC. While China is aggressively pursuing self-sufficiency in AI chips, the latest intelligence suggests significant and ongoing manufacturing hurdles for Huawei's most advanced offering.

A critical, non-consensus development is the reported **postponement of Ascend 910C mass production until the end of 2025** due to "certain technical issues" and supply chain struggles. This report, published on June 6, 2025, directly contradicts earlier reports from April and May 2025 that indicated mass shipments were commencing or had already begun. If accurate, this means that the Ascend 910C would have had a very limited, if any, presence in the Chinese AI chip market during NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026, significantly reducing the immediate competitive pressure on NVIDIA in that region.

Furthermore, there's a discrepancy in reported production yields. While some sources in February 2025 indicated that yields for the 910C (manufactured on SMIC's 7nm N+2 process) had improved to nearly 40% and made the line profitable, other analyst estimates as late as May 2025 still cited yields as low as 30%. This persistent struggle to achieve commercially viable yields (typically over 70%) underscores the deep-seated challenges SMIC faces due to US export controls, particularly its reliance on Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography instead of more advanced Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) technology.

Adding to these production woes, a US Commerce official in June 2025 estimated that Huawei is expected to produce no more than 200,000 Ascend-series AI chips in all of 2025. This figure is substantially lower than Huawei's own reported target of 700,000+ units for the year, highlighting the severe limitations imposed by manufacturing constraints.

In summary, the combination of a reported mass production delay for the Ascend 910C, inconsistent and generally low yield rates, and a significantly lower official US estimate for Huawei's total 2025 AI chip output suggests that Huawei's ability to displace NVIDIA in the Chinese market in the near term is more constrained than widely understood. This could lead to a more favorable outlook for NVIDIA's China-related revenue or guidance than anticipated, despite ongoing US export restrictions on NVIDIA's own advanced chips.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Huawei was about to begin the mass production of the Ascend 910C chips this month, but the company has reportedly postponed its plan. A new input reveals that the tech giant might initiate the respective activity by the end of this year. X tipster @Jukanlosreve says that Huawei has postponed the Ascend 910C mass production to the end of this year. The company has delayed the AI chip manufacturing due to certain technical issues appeared in the chipset."
    *   **Date:** June 6, 2025
    *   **Source:** Huawei reportedly postponed Ascend 910C AI chip mass production, Vertex AI Search (citing X tipster @Jukanlosreve)
    *   **Impact:** High. This is highly material. A postponement of mass production until year-end 2025 means minimal to no Ascend 910C chips were significantly available during NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 (ending July 2025), directly reducing competitive pressure in China.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This specific postponement, especially contradicting earlier reports of shipments, is likely non-consensus and could surprise the market.

*   **Snippet:** "Huawei's Ascend 910C AI chip has reportedly reached a 40% manufacturing yield, marking the first time the Ascend production line has turned profitable. The company aims to improve the yield to 60%, bringing it closer to industry standards."
    *   **Date:** February 25, 2025
    *   **Source:** Huawei Ascend 910C reportedly hits 40% yield, turns profitable; aims for 60% industry standard - DIGITIMES Asia (citing Financial Times)
    *   **Impact:** Medium. While an improvement from earlier 20% yields, 40% is still significantly below the 70%+ industry standard for commercial viability, indicating persistent manufacturing challenges at SMIC.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that yields improved, but the *implication* of still-subpar yields despite profitability might be overlooked in terms of actual market impact on supply.

*   **Snippet:** "According to Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh, only 30% of the Ascend 910c chips meet production standards. That's a crushing blow for Huawei, which is banking on the 910c to fill the market gap left by NVIDIA's H20 chips, now banned from export to China." "In China, we estimate Ascend 910A/B/C potentially at 700K+ units in 2025E, but yields at key foundry SMIC remain fairly low, we estimate – 30%.”

    *   **Source:** Ascend 910c Production Crisis — Can Huawei Hit 700000 Shipments Amid 30% Yields? - SemiAnalysis, Huawei to ship 700K+ Ascend 910 chips despite SMIC's low yields: Analysts - Huawei Central
    *   **Impact:** High. This analyst estimate from May 2025, suggesting yields are still at 30%, directly contradicts the 40% reported in February, reinforcing the narrative of significant, ongoing production difficulties and further reducing the immediate competitive threat to NVIDIA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. The discrepancy in reported yield rates (40% vs. 30%) within a short timeframe is a key non-consensus data point, suggesting greater ongoing struggles than some might believe.

*   **Snippet:** "Huawei Technologies is expected to produce no more than 200,000 Ascend-series AI chips in 2025, according to the US Department of Commerce, highlighting China's advancing chip design capabilities while also exposing its enduring manufacturing constraints."
    *   **Date:** June 13, 2025
    *   **Source:** US export controls to cap Huawei AI chip output in 2025 - Tech in Asia (citing US Commerce official)
    *   **Impact:** High. This official US estimate of Huawei's total 2025 Ascend AI chip production is significantly lower than Huawei's own reported targets. This indicates a severe limitation on Huawei's ability to scale, which directly benefits NVIDIA by reducing the available domestic alternative in China.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While US sanctions are consensus, a specific, low official cap on Huawei's total AI chip output for the year is a concrete data point that might not be fully priced into market expectations regarding NVIDIA's competitive landscape in China.

*   **Snippet:** "China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International (OTCQX:SIUIF) is making some main components of the GPUs using its N+2 7nm process technology, however its chip yield rates are low, a source previously told the media outlet." "SMIC manufactures the Ascend 910c using a 7nm DUV process but struggles to maintain yield rates."
    *   **Date:** April 21, 2025, May 18, 2025
    *   **Source:** China's Huawei set for mass shipment of new AI chip amid Nvidia's H20 woes - report - Seeking Alpha, Ascend 910c Production Crisis — Can Huawei Hit 700000 Shipments Amid 30% Yields? - SemiAnalysis
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the underlying manufacturing challenges at SMIC due to DUV reliance, which inherently leads to lower yields and higher costs for advanced nodes. This structural issue limits Huawei's ability to rapidly scale production, reinforcing the competitive advantage for NVIDIA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that SMIC uses DUV and faces challenges, but the direct link to *low yield rates for Ascend 910C* is an important reinforcing detail for the non-consensus view of Huawei's struggles.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Mass Production Start Date:** There is a direct contradiction regarding the mass production/shipment of Ascend 910C. Reports from April/May 2025 indicated mass shipments were starting or had already begun, while a June 6, 2025 report explicitly states mass production was *postponed until year-end 2025* due to technical issues. This is a critical gap for assessing Q2 FY2026 impact.
*   **Yield Rate Discrepancy:** While some sources cited a 40% yield for Ascend 910C in February 2025, other analyst estimates from May 2025 still placed it at 30%. This suggests either ongoing variability or a more pessimistic view from some analysts regarding SMIC's actual progress.
*   **Production Volume Targets vs. Reality:** Huawei's ambitious target of 700,000+ Ascend series chips for 2025 is significantly higher than the US Commerce Department's estimated 200,000-unit cap, indicating a substantial gap between Huawei's aspirations and its current manufacturing reality under sanctions.
