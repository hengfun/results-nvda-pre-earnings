## Analysis

NVIDIA is poised to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, for the quarter ending July 2025. Analysis of recent developments in its supply chain, particularly concerning manufacturing shifts in Southeast Asia and the evolving landscape in China, reveals several material, non-consensus factors likely to influence the upcoming report and forward-looking guidance.

A significant, recent development is the U.S. government's agreement with NVIDIA to resume sales of H20 AI chips to China, albeit with a 15% revenue-sharing arrangement. While this deal could substantially boost NVIDIA's revenue from the Chinese market, the associated levy is expected to temper gross margins. Simultaneously, the U.S. is tightening export controls on high-end NVIDIA AI chips destined for Malaysia and Thailand, aiming to prevent indirect access by China, which could introduce new complexities and costs to NVIDIA's Southeast Asian supply chain.

NVIDIA's strategic investments in Vietnam, including a $200 million AI factory with FPT Corporation that began operations in late 2024 and is expected to be profitable from 2025, signal a tangible shift towards diversifying its manufacturing footprint. However, a reported halt in H20 chip production for China due to Beijing's security concerns introduces a potential contradiction and uncertainty regarding the full impact of the new revenue-sharing deal. These dynamics collectively suggest a complex interplay of revenue opportunities, margin pressures, and operational adjustments that could surprise the market.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "A significant development emerged in August 2025 where NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to share 15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licences. This arrangement allows NVIDIA to resume H20 AI chip sales designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export controls. The financial impact warrants attention. While China represents 13% of NVIDIA's revenue by customer billing location in FY 2025, actual contribution may be higher due to trans-shipment orders. Assuming restriction removal doubles China sales while other regions remain flat, this could boost NVIDIA's revenue by over 10%. The benefits are expected to outweigh the 15% government levy, which could reduce total revenue by approximately 3% if China's share of sales rises to 25%."

    *   **Impact:** High. This directly impacts Q2 FY2026 revenue and gross margins. The 15% revenue share is a new, specific financial arrangement that will reduce gross margins (forecasted to 71.3% from an expected mid-70% range), even as it potentially boosts overall revenue by enabling sales to a significant market.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While the general idea of a deal with China might be known, the specific 15% revenue-sharing detail and its direct, quantifiable impact on Q2 FY2026 revenue and margin calculations (e.g., "reduce total revenue by approximately 3%") could be non-consensus or not fully priced into analyst models.

*   **Snippet:** "The US is preparing stricter export controls on high-end Nvidia AI chips destined for Malaysia and Thailand, in a move to block China's indirect access to advanced GPU hardware. According to sources cited by Bloomberg, the new restrictions would require exporters to obtain licences before sending AI processors to either country. The change follows reports that Chinese engineers have hand-carried data to Malaysia for AI training after Singapore began restricting chip re-exports. Washington suspects Chinese firms are using Southeast Asian intermediaries, including shell companies, to bypass existing export bans on AI chips like Nvidia's H100."

    *   **Impact:** High. This introduces new regulatory hurdles and potential supply chain disruptions or increased compliance costs for NVIDIA's operations involving Malaysia and Thailand. It could affect lead times, logistics, and the efficiency of its Southeast Asian supply chain, particularly if these countries are involved in the re-export or final assembly of AI chips.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While general US export controls are known, the specific targeting of Malaysia and Thailand for "high-end Nvidia AI chips" and the requirement for *new licenses* to prevent indirect China access is a more granular, potentially overlooked detail that could impact Q2 FY2026 operational efficiency and costs.

*   **Snippet:** "Prior to this partnership, in April 2024, it formed a strategic alliance with IT leader FPT Corporation to create a US$200 million one-stop AI factory in Hanoi, powered by NVIDIA's latest technologies. The first FPT AI factory began operations in November 2024, with profitability expected from 2025."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This investment signifies a tangible step in NVIDIA's Southeast Asia diversification strategy. While the factory began operations in late 2024, the expectation of profitability "from 2025" suggests it could start contributing positively to margins in Q2 FY2026, or at least begin to offset initial investment costs, indicating a forward-looking positive trend.
    *   **Consensus Check:** NVIDIA's general interest in Vietnam might be known, but the specific detail of a $200 million AI factory with FPT, its operational start date (November 2024), and the explicit expectation of profitability "from 2025" could be a non-consensus detail regarding its near-term financial contribution and the speed of diversification.

*   **Snippet:** "Separately, Nvidia has reportedly asked some suppliers to halt work on its China-focused H20 chips after security concerns from Beijing, with Foxconn among those affected."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-22
    *   **Source:** Tech in Asia
    *   **Impact:** High. This report introduces significant uncertainty and a potential contradiction to the positive outlook from the H20 revenue-sharing deal. A halt in production, even if temporary or partial, could directly impact Q2 FY2026 sales volume to China and potentially incur costs related to halted production or inventory management.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This specific report of a *halt* in H20 chip work due to Beijing's concerns, especially so close to the earnings report and in light of the new revenue-sharing deal, is a highly non-consensus or overlooked piece of information that creates ambiguity around NVIDIA's China sales trajectory for Q2 FY2026.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

The most notable contradiction lies between the reported U.S.-China revenue-sharing deal allowing H20 chip sales and the report of NVIDIA asking suppliers to halt work on H20 chips due to Beijing's security concerns. This suggests that while a framework for sales exists, the actual execution might be facing immediate headwinds or additional complexities from the Chinese side. This gap in understanding the current status of H20 production and sales to China is a critical piece of non-consensus information that could significantly impact Q2 FY2026 results.

Furthermore, while there is clear evidence of manufacturing shifts *to* Southeast Asia and NVIDIA's investments in the region, specific quantifiable impacts on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 supply costs and margins directly attributable to these shifts (beyond the general expectation of profitability from the Vietnam factory) are not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets. The new U.S. export controls on Malaysia and Thailand could also introduce unforeseen costs or delays, partially offsetting any benefits from diversification.
