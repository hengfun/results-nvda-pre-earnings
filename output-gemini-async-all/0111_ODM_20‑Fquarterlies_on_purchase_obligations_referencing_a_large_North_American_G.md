## Analysis

As a pre-earnings research analyst, the objective is to identify material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. While direct "ODM 20-F/quarterlies on purchase obligations referencing a 'large North American GPU customer'" are not explicitly found, significant and quantifiable insights into NVIDIA's backlog and demand from a key North American AI cloud provider, CoreWeave, and NVIDIA's own manufacturing commitments have been extracted. This information, particularly the specific figures, offers a non-consensus perspective beyond general market optimism.

NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025. Consensus expectations are for robust performance, driven largely by its Data Center segment and strong demand from cloud service providers for its AI GPUs, including the new Blackwell platform. However, potential headwinds from China export curbs remain a concern.

### Structured Findings:

**1. CoreWeave's Expanding Backlog and Demand Outstripping Supply**

*   **Snippet:** "Driven by the OpenAI expansion and new wins across enterprises and AI startups, CRWV's contracted backlog reached $30.1 billion, up $4 billion sequentially and doubling year to date."
*   **Snippet:** "The company is on its way to deliver 900 megawatts of active data center capacity by the end of 2025, and its revenue backlog has doubled to $30.1 billion."
*   **Snippet:** "We have 2.2 gigawatts of contracted power in our portfolio, and we are continuously looking to add more. We have 470 megawatts of active power at the end of Q2. And Mike talked a little bit about this as well on the earnings call, where by the end of the year, we are projecting to be over 900 megawatts of active power. So we are rapidly scaling in terms of our capacity to meet the end customer demand, but the demand continues to outstrip supply at this moment for us. and the signals in the market continue to be that way."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025, August 21, 2025, August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** Barchart.com, Seeking Alpha, Deutsche Bank's 2025 Technology Conference
*   **Impact:** **High**. CoreWeave is a major AI cloud provider and a significant NVIDIA partner, representing a "large North American GPU customer." Its disclosed contracted backlog of $30.1 billion, which has doubled year-to-date and is still experiencing demand outstripping supply, directly translates to substantial, ongoing demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. This quantifiable figure provides concrete evidence of robust, long-term demand from a critical customer segment, potentially indicating upside to NVIDIA's forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** While general strong demand from hyperscalers is widely known, the specific, quantified backlog of $30.1 billion from a single, prominent NVIDIA partner like CoreWeave, and the explicit statement that "demand continues to outstrip supply", could be considered non-consensus in its specificity and magnitude. This level of detail from a customer's disclosure is less frequently highlighted in broad NVIDIA earnings previews.

**2. NVIDIA's Substantial Manufacturing Commitments**

*   **Snippet:** "CFO Colette Kress confirmed during the analyst call that 'Microsoft has already deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and is expected to ramp to hundreds of thousands,' with OpenAI named as a key customer. Blackwell contributed nearly 70 percent of data centre compute revenue in the quarter, and Kress called the ramp 'the fastest in our company's history.' ... Kress noted that Nvidia has US$29.8bn in manufacturing commitments."
*   **Snippet:** "“We've made substantial, long-term purchase commitments, a deep investment in America's AI manufacturing future,” he said."
*   **Date:** May 29, 2025
*   **Source:** Capital.com (citing Nvidia's Q1 FY2026 earnings call)
*   **Impact:** **High**. NVIDIA's own disclosure of $29.8 billion in manufacturing commitments serves as a strong indicator of anticipated future demand from its customers, including large North American GPU customers. This figure represents NVIDIA's confidence in sustained, high-volume orders, underpinning its revenue visibility. The context of Microsoft and OpenAI deploying Blackwell GPUs further solidifies the source of this demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** While NVIDIA's strong demand is consensus, the specific, large figure of $29.8 billion in manufacturing commitments, directly from the CFO, might not be fully appreciated or integrated into all analyst models as a forward-looking indicator of *guaranteed* demand, especially concerning its implications for the next several quarters.

### Analysis:

The research indicates that while direct "ODM 20-F/quarterlies" with specific customer names are elusive due to confidentiality, the spirit of the query has been addressed through disclosures from a major AI cloud provider (CoreWeave) and NVIDIA's own financial statements.

The **$30.1 billion contracted backlog of CoreWeave** is a highly material, non-consensus data point. CoreWeave is a significant player in the AI cloud infrastructure, heavily reliant on NVIDIA GPUs, and its rapid expansion and unmet demand signal a robust pipeline for NVIDIA. This figure, coupled with CoreWeave's statements about demand outstripping supply, suggests that NVIDIA's sales to this "large North American GPU customer" are not just strong but capacity-constrained, implying continued pricing power and strong revenue potential.

Similarly, **NVIDIA's $29.8 billion in manufacturing commitments** directly quantifies the company's confidence in future demand. This figure, disclosed by the CFO, represents the financial obligations NVIDIA has undertaken to secure the necessary components and manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated customer orders. This is a powerful, albeit indirect, measure of backlog exposure driven by its diverse customer base, including large North American hyperscalers.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradictions:** There are no direct contradictions found regarding the demand from large North American GPU customers. The general sentiment is overwhelmingly positive regarding hyperscaler demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs.
*   **Gaps:** The primary gap remains the inability to directly extract specific purchase obligations from *other* ODMs (like Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron) that explicitly name a "large North American GPU customer" and quantify their backlog *for NVIDIA*. The information found on ODMs largely pertains to the impact of China export curbs on H20 chips, which represents a different segment and a *headwind* rather than a *quantified obligation* from a North American customer. However, the CoreWeave data and NVIDIA's own commitments provide a strong proxy for the underlying demand.

In conclusion, the quantified backlog from CoreWeave and NVIDIA's substantial manufacturing commitments provide strong, specific, and potentially non-consensus insights into the sustained and robust demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs from its largest customers, which is likely to positively impact its upcoming earnings and forward guidance.
