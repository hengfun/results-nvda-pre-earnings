## Analysis

NVIDIA is poised to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, with significant attention on its burgeoning robotics segment, particularly following the recent general availability of its powerful Jetson AGX Thor platform. While NVIDIA's dominance in the broader AI chip market is widely acknowledged, the rapid acceleration and strategic importance of its robotics initiatives, though currently a small portion of overall revenue, present a material, non-consensus opportunity that could significantly influence forward-looking guidance.

The company's Automotive and Robotics segment demonstrated robust growth, reporting $567 million in sales for Q1 FY2026 (quarter ending April 2025), a substantial 72% year-over-year increase. This segment, while currently accounting for only about 1% of NVIDIA's total revenue, is seen by CEO Jensen Huang as the "biggest growth opportunity outside AI" and potentially "the next trillion-dollar opportunity."

The newly launched Jetson AGX Thor, built on the Blackwell GPU architecture, is a key driver of this growth. It offers a 7.5x increase in AI compute performance and 3.5x greater energy efficiency compared to its predecessor, Jetson Orin, and features 128GB of memory, enabling complex generative AI models and real-time processing directly on robots. This advanced capability is attracting significant industry adoption, with major players like Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure AI, and Meta already integrating or evaluating Jetson Thor.

A notable development is NVIDIA's partnership with Foxconn, with plans to commence humanoid robot production in the US by November, concurrently with Blackwell Ultra GB300 AI servers. This direct involvement in manufacturing, even through a partner, signals an aggressive push into the "physical AI" domain.

However, the Jetson Thor developer kit is priced at $3,499, more than double the $1,499 price tag of the Jetson Orin. While this higher price is justified by the significant performance leap for advanced applications, it suggests that some vendors focused on simpler tasks might still opt for lower-priced alternatives. NVIDIA's strategy to overcome this involves leveraging its comprehensive hardware-software integration, including the JetPack 7 software suite and Isaac robotics development platform, to accelerate development cycles and maximize the value of its higher AI compute costs.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's Q2 2025 financials underscore the platform's potential.
