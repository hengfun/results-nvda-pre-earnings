## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information regarding HBM substrate capacity constraints and their potential impact on NVIDIA's Q3/Q4 shipments, based on web content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The overarching theme from recent supply chain reports is that while High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and advanced packaging (CoWoS) capacities are expanding significantly, the underlying substrate materials, particularly for advanced packaging, remain a critical bottleneck. This bottleneck is likely to persist well into 2026, potentially limiting NVIDIA's ability to fully capitalize on the surging demand for its AI accelerators in Q3 and Q4 FY2026.

Specifically, the global supply of Ajinomoto Build-up Film (ABF) substrates, essential for high-density AI chips, is expected to remain tight until 2026. More acutely, high-end fiberglass fabrics, a key component in IC substrates, are facing a structural shortage, with Japanese suppliers shifting focus to specialty materials. This has led to anticipated price hikes of up to 20% for these high-end fabrics and BT substrates starting in August 2025. The lack of new T-Glass capacity from Nitto Boseki until the second half of 2026 further exacerbates this issue.

The increasing complexity and size of AI chip packages, driven by the integration of more HBM and larger GPU dies, are also contributing to reduced panel efficiency and increased yield loss in substrate manufacturing. While TSMC is aggressively expanding its CoWoS capacity, and NVIDIA has secured a significant portion of it, the foundational substrate supply chain appears to be the "quiet Achilles' heel." This suggests that even with sufficient HBM and CoWoS capacity, the availability and cost of advanced substrates could constrain NVIDIA's shipment volumes and impact its gross margins in the latter half of 2025 and potentially beyond. NVIDIA's move to develop its own HBM Base Die highlights the strategic importance of controlling key components, but this is a longer-term initiative.

**Structured Findings:**

---

-   **Snippet:** "The global ABF capacity remains tight until 2026. Opportunity: Greenfield ABF fabs in Southeast Asia, India's Dholera semiconductor zone, and Arizona. Glass-core R&D collaboration with Japanese or Korean suppliers could also yield long-term gains."
-   **Date:** July 1, 2025
-   **Source:** Techovedas, techovedas.com
-   **Impact:** High. Reasoning: ABF substrates are fundamental for advanced AI chip packaging. A persistent tightness until 2026 directly implies a potential constraint on NVIDIA's ability to scale shipments, impacting Q3/Q4 FY2026 and potentially beyond.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general supply chain tightness is known, the specific duration (until 2026) and the focus on ABF as a "quiet Achilles' heel" are more granular and less widely discussed than CoWoS or HBM.

-   **Snippet:** "According to Commercial Times, BT substrate prices have been climbing since July, and prices for high-end fiberglass fabrics used in IC substrates are also set to rise further in August. On the materials front, a structural shortage is hitting high-grade fiberglass fabrics. Commercial Times notes that Japanese suppliers have shifted production toward high-margin specialty materials like low-Dk and low-CTE fiberglass, widening the supply gap to over 10%. Starting in August, prices for these high-end fabrics used in IC substrates are expected to jump up to 20%, the report adds."
-   **Date:** July 22, 2025
-   **Source:** TrendForce, trendforce.com
-   **Impact:** High. Reasoning: Direct price hikes of up to 20% for critical substrate materials (fiberglass fabrics, BT substrates) starting in August 2025 will immediately impact NVIDIA's cost of goods sold for Q3 and Q4, potentially compressing gross margins if not fully passed on to customers. The "structural shortage" indicates a persistent issue.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While material cost increases are generally anticipated, the specific magnitude (up to 20%) and timing (starting August) for these particular high-end substrate components are specific and likely not fully priced into consensus expectations.

---

-   **Snippet:** "In the long run, Commercial Times notes that with new T-Glass capacity from Nitto Boseki not expected until the second half of 2026, the short-term supply crunch is unlikely to ease—giving suppliers continued pricing leverage. Beyond BT substrates, ABF (Ajinomoto Build-up Film) shipments are surging as well, driven by rising AI chip demand and the shift toward multi-chip and HBM packaging."
-   **Date:** July 22, 2025
-   **Source:** TrendForce, trendforce.com
-   **Impact:** High. Reasoning: The explicit timeline for new T-Glass capacity (H2 2026) confirms that the fiberglass shortage, a key input for substrates, will be a prolonged issue. This reinforces the long-term nature of the substrate bottleneck and its potential to constrain NVIDIA's growth through 2025 and well into 2026.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific supplier (Nitto Boseki) and the clear timeline for capacity expansion provide a concrete detail that might not be widely known or fully appreciated in consensus models.

-   **Snippet:** "In IBIDEN slide, it is clear to see the trend underscores a core challenge in AI hardware development: as models grow in complexity and demand more memory bandwidth and chip interconnects, packaging substrates must scale in both area and layer count. However, this comes at the cost of reduced panel efficiency and increased yield loss, emphasizing the need for innovation in materials, design rules, and defect management strategies."
-   **Date:** June 29, 2025
-   **Source:** semivision, semivision.com
-   **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: This highlights a fundamental challenge in advanced packaging substrates. Reduced panel efficiency and increased yield loss directly translate to higher costs and potentially lower available supply, even if raw capacity expands. This impacts the overall economics and scalability for NVIDIA's high-end products.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the complexity of AI chips is known, the specific impact on *panel efficiency and yield loss* for substrates as a direct constraint is a more nuanced point that may not be fully factored into broader market expectations.

-   **Snippet:** "Another chokepoint is substrates: the advanced substrate laminates needed for these huge chips are in finite supply globally. If CoWoS and HBM are the flashiest constraints, ABF substrates are the quiet Achilles' heel — multi-layer boards that require long lead times to manufacture. In short, NVIDIA's one-year cadence must be matched by a one-year supply-chain ladder, where each rung (wafer, packaging, memory, substrate) scales up in concert."
-   **Date:** July 4, 2025
-   **Source:** The Annual Cadence Gamble: Can NVIDIA Keep Launching a New Platform Each Spring?
-   **Impact:** High. Reasoning: This snippet explicitly identifies advanced substrate laminates as a "chokepoint" and the "quiet Achilles' heel," emphasizing their finite global supply and long lead times. This directly supports the idea that substrates, not just CoWoS or HBM, are a critical limiting factor for NVIDIA's rapid product cadence and shipment goals.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The "quiet Achilles' heel" framing suggests this is a less obvious but highly impactful constraint compared to the more frequently discussed CoWoS and HBM bottlenecks.

-   **Snippet:** "TSMC Reserves 70% of 2025 CoWoS-L Capacity for NVIDIA... NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture GPUs are in strong demand, leading the company to secure over 70% of TSMC's CoWoS-L advanced packaging capacity for 2025. Shipment volumes are projected to rise by more than 20% each quarter, with total annual shipments expected to surpass 2 million units."
-   **Date:** August 19, 2025
-   **Source:** TechPowerUp, techpowerup.com (citing Economic Daily News)
-   **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: While this indicates NVIDIA is aggressively securing packaging capacity, it doesn't negate the substrate constraints. It shows NVIDIA's proactive measures but also implies that CoWoS capacity *is* a constraint if 70% needs to be reserved. The "more than 20% each quarter" shipment rise is positive but could still be limited by other factors like substrates.
-   **Consensus Check:** Widely Known. NVIDIA's strong demand and efforts to secure CoWoS capacity are generally known, though the specific 70% figure for 2025 might be more granular. This is more of a confirmation of existing demand and NVIDIA's strategic response rather than a non-consensus constraint.

-   **Snippet:** "In March 2025, SK hynix became the first in the industry to supply 12-layer HBM4 samples to major customers. The product is slated for mass production in the second half of this year. ... Furthermore, the company unveiled a roadmap for its 16-layer HBM4, targeted for launch in 2026. In addition, SK hynix presented its 36 GB 12-layer HBM3E, installed in NVIDIA's AI server GPU module GB200."
-   **Date:** June 5, 2025
-   **Source:** SK hynix Newsroom, skhynix.com
-   **Impact:** Low. Reasoning: This confirms strong HBM supply and innovation from SK Hynix, a key NVIDIA partner. While positive for NVIDIA's long-term product roadmap, it doesn't directly address substrate constraints for Q3/Q4 FY2026 and is generally in line with expectations of increasing HBM availability.
-   **Consensus Check:** Widely Known. The ramp-up of HBM3E and HBM4 by major memory players like SK Hynix is a well-covered industry trend.
