## Analysis

NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, and the market will be keenly focused on forward-looking guidance, particularly for Q3 FY2026. Recent disclosures and reports from SK hynix, a critical supplier of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, offer several material, non-consensus insights that could influence NVIDIA's outlook. While SK hynix reported robust HBM sales in Q2 2025 and anticipates continued strong demand, a key contradiction regarding HBM3E exclusivity for NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra and ongoing negotiations for 2026 supply present nuanced risks and opportunities.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: Contradiction on SK hynix's HBM3E 12-High Exclusivity for NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra**

*   **Snippet:** "SK hynix stands to benefit as the exclusive supplier of 12H HBM3E for the Blackwell Ultra, according to South Korean media outlet Business Post."
*   **Date:** March 18, 2025
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (citing Business Post),
*   **Impact:** High. If SK hynix is not the exclusive supplier, it implies NVIDIA has diversified its HBM3E 12-high sourcing for Blackwell Ultra, which could affect SK hynix's pricing power and NVIDIA's supply chain dynamics. This is a direct contradiction to the more recent information below.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While the initial report suggested exclusivity, the market may not be fully pricing in the implications of multiple suppliers for such a critical component.

*   **Snippet:** "Micron has begun volume shipments of HBM3E qualified for Blackwell Ultra."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (citing Wall Street Journal),
*   **Impact:** High. This directly contradicts the earlier report of SK hynix's exclusivity. Micron's entry as a volume supplier for Blackwell Ultra's HBM3E 12-high chips suggests NVIDIA has a more diversified supply chain than previously understood, potentially reducing reliance on a single vendor and offering better supply stability or pricing leverage.
*   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. The market may still be operating under the assumption of SK hynix's primary, if not exclusive, role for Blackwell Ultra HBM3E 12-high. This recent development from Micron could be a positive for NVIDIA's supply security but might temper expectations for SK hynix's outsized gains from this specific product.

**Finding 2: Samsung's Continued Delays in NVIDIA HBM3E Qualification**

*   **Snippet:** "Samsung, still struggling with NVIDIA's 12Hi HBM3e verification, is expected to drop to 28.7%, down from 41% last year, while Micron rises to 19%."
*   **Date:** August 18, 2025
*   **Source:** TrendForce (via Vertex AI Search),
*   **Impact:** Medium. Samsung's ongoing struggles to qualify its 12-high HBM3E with NVIDIA mean that NVIDIA's supply for its latest AI GPUs remains heavily concentrated with SK hynix and Micron. While this strengthens the position of the qualified suppliers, it also highlights a potential bottleneck if demand significantly outstrips the combined capacity of SK hynix and Micron.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the continued and specific market share projections (SK hynix 52.3%, Samsung 28.7%, Micron 19% for 2025 HBM market share) provide a more granular, potentially non-consensus view of the competitive landscape.

*   **Snippet:** "Chae Min-sook, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, noted that Samsung's HBM certification for Nvidia has been pushed to late Q3."
*   **Date:** July 8, 2025
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (citing Korea Investment & Securities),
*   **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the ongoing delay for Samsung's HBM3E certification with NVIDIA, pushing it to the very end of NVIDIA's Q3 FY2026. This reinforces the reliance on SK hynix and Micron for NVIDIA's HBM3E needs in the current and upcoming quarter.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known among industry followers, but the specific timing of "late Q3" for certification could be a more precise detail that analysts might not fully incorporate into their models.

**Finding 3: NVIDIA's Growing Revenue Contribution to SK hynix**

*   **Snippet:** "According to Yonhap News, the company reportedly earned around ₩11 trillion in revenue from NVIDIA alone in the first half of this year. Notably, citing data provided by SK hynix, Yonhap reports that revenue from a single “major customer” reached ₩10.89 trillion in the first half of 2025. With SK hynix's consolidated revenue totaling ₩39.87 trillion for the same period, roughly 27% of its total revenue came from just this one client, the report adds. While SK hynix did not officially name the customer, industry insiders cited in the report point to NVIDIA."
*   **Date:** August 18, 2025
*   **Source:** TrendForce (citing Yonhap News),
*   **Impact:** High. This specific data point quantifies NVIDIA's significant and growing contribution to SK hynix's revenue, reaching 27% in 1H 2025, up from 16% in 2024. This underscores the deep interdependence between the two companies and highlights the material impact of NVIDIA's demand on SK hynix's financial performance. For NVIDIA, it indicates a strong, albeit concentrated, supply relationship.
*   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. While the strong relationship is known, this precise revenue percentage and its year-over-year growth provide a more concrete and potentially underappreciated aspect of their partnership.

**Finding 4: Nuanced Update on 2026 HBM Supply Negotiations**

*   **Snippet:** "The report suggests that the company had initially planned to finalize 2026's HBM supply with NVIDIA by mid-2025, but negotiations dragged into this month."
*   **Date:** August 18, 2025
*   **Source:** TrendForce (citing ZDNet),
*   **Impact:** Medium. While SK hynix stated in its Q2 2025 earnings call (July 24, 2025) that discussions for 2026 supply were "proceeding as planned", this more recent report suggests a slight delay in finalizing those agreements. This could imply more complex negotiations, potentially related to pricing, volume, or technology transitions (e.g., HBM4). Any protracted negotiations could introduce uncertainty into NVIDIA's long-term supply visibility.
*   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. The market might have interpreted "proceeding as planned" as a smooth and timely finalization. The detail that negotiations "dragged into this month" (August) suggests a more nuanced and potentially less straightforward process.

**Finding 5: SK hynix's HBM Capacity Sold Out for 2025, Almost Fully Booked for 2026**

*   **Snippet:** "In May, SK Hynix Chief Executive Kwak Noh-Jung said its HBM chips were sold out for this year and its capacity is almost fully booked for 2025."
*   **Date:** July 25, 2024 (reporting on May 2024 statement)
*   **Source:** KED Global,
*   **Impact:** High. This indicates extremely strong demand for SK hynix's HBM products, including HBM3E, which are critical for NVIDIA's AI accelerators. For NVIDIA, this implies a secure, but potentially constrained, supply for the remainder of FY2026 and into FY2027. It also suggests strong pricing power for SK hynix, which could translate to higher component costs for NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that HBM demand is high, but the explicit "sold out for this year" and "almost fully booked for 2025" (calendar year) provides a strong, specific confirmation of the tight supply situation.

**Summary Analysis for NVIDIA's Earnings:**

The information suggests a mixed but generally strong picture for NVIDIA's HBM supply. On the positive side, SK hynix's HBM3E 12-high production is expanding, and their products are well-regarded by customers, contributing significantly to SK hynix's record profits. The fact that HBM capacity is sold out for 2025 and nearly booked for 2026 indicates robust underlying demand for AI accelerators, which benefits NVIDIA.

However, the non-consensus elements introduce some complexity:
*   **Blackwell Ultra HBM3E Supply:** The contradiction regarding SK hynix's exclusivity for Blackwell Ultra's 12-high HBM3E, with Micron now also shipping, suggests NVIDIA has successfully diversified its supply. This could be a positive for NVIDIA's supply chain resilience but might slightly dilute the "exclusive supplier" narrative that could have implied higher margins for SK hynix.
*   **Samsung's Continued Absence:** Samsung's ongoing delays in qualifying its HBM3E with NVIDIA mean that NVIDIA's HBM3E supply for the immediate future remains concentrated with SK hynix and Micron. This could be a risk if either of the primary suppliers faces unexpected production issues.
*   **2026 Supply Negotiations:** The reported "dragging" of 2026 HBM supply negotiations between SK hynix and NVIDIA, despite SK hynix's earlier "proceeding as planned" statement, could signal more intricate discussions. This might involve pricing, volume commitments, or the transition to next-generation HBM4, and could introduce a slight element of uncertainty into NVIDIA's long-term supply agreements.

Overall, while NVIDIA's demand for HBM remains exceptionally strong, the details from SK hynix's recent communications suggest a dynamic and competitive supply landscape, with NVIDIA actively managing its sourcing to ensure robust supply for its next-generation products. The market will be looking for NVIDIA's commentary on its HBM supply chain, particularly for Blackwell and future platforms, and how these dynamics might impact its gross margins and ability to meet demand.
