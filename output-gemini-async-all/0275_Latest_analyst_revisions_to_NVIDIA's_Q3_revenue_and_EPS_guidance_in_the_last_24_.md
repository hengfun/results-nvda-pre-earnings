## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, I have identified several key pieces of information regarding NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking Q3 guidance. The most material and non-consensus insights revolve around differing Q3 EPS expectations and significant divergence in gross margin projections, particularly concerning the impact of new product ramps and export controls.

While some analysts have recently adjusted their price targets and Q2 estimates, the most impactful non-consensus data points pertain to the outlook for Q3 FY2026, which will be a critical focus of today's earnings call. A notable divergence exists in Q3 EPS expectations, with some "street" estimates significantly higher than a recently updated analyst forecast. Furthermore, there is a stark non-consensus view on Q3 gross margins, with a substantial portion of respondents in a survey anticipating a much lower margin than the sell-side consensus, largely due to potential pressures from new product ramps and export fees.

### Structured Findings:

*   **Snippet:** "Wedbush analyst M. Bryson now expects that the computer hardware maker will post earnings of $0.93 per share for the quarter, up from their previous estimate of $0.92. Wedbush also issued estimates for NVIDIA's Q3 2026 earnings at $1.10 EPS..."

    *   **Source:** Wedbush Research Analysts Lift Earnings Estimates for NVIDIA - MarketBeat, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHw_Tq0JrsS3cDMpWMCzlw0Ho8G9xul1kv63d9Gkd20fdsMT-3Jw3cJ8gsH6zKYN6SX1dE0GC6LI68VImNqnVvpP4ZDBZSDHO3GJ_74C9ZK8M4F0Ql_mT5tBJIJyQoJDSuE5527Jt40Cme-B2awfH7-SjRbwqo8WkspGETQ9I6eHSXcT2PyZfphdbaVSE8VZWKdQG7c5nKML6wkIb5t9LlnmA==
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This is a specific, recent analyst revision for Q3 EPS, providing a concrete data point for comparison against other estimates and company guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is a specific analyst's updated estimate, which contributes to the broader consensus. The "non-consensus" aspect would be if this estimate significantly deviates from the overall average, which needs to be compared with other estimates.

*   **Snippet:** "Some on the street expect Q3 FY2026 revenue guide near $55 billion with EPS around $1.25 as Blackwell shipments increase and networking mix rises."
    *   **Date:** August 26, 2025 (for Source 2), Undated but recent (for Source 8)

    *   **Impact:** High. This represents a potentially higher-end "street" expectation for Q3 FY2026 EPS ($1.25) compared to Wedbush's $1.10. If NVIDIA guides towards or above this higher figure, it could be a significant positive surprise. The revenue figure of $55 billion is also a strong forward indicator.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is presented as an expectation from "some on the street," suggesting it might be a more bullish or less widely adopted view than the general consensus, making it non-consensus.

*   **Snippet:** "MARGINS: Margins will be the key issue here. There has been talk of potential margin pressure on early GB300 ramps the the market will want clarity on. Also, a 15% license fee will be incurred on Chinese revenue, which is expected to impact gross margin by 50–60bps. There has been speculation that Nvidia will offset that with price hikes, which we will have to see confirmation of. FQ3 gross margin is expected to be 73.5%. Roughly one-third of survey respondents expect gross margin to be ~58%, while the other two-thirds are still clustered around 65–72%, despite the sell-side consensus remaining at 71.1%."
    *   **Date:** Undated, but contextually very recent and relevant to upcoming earnings.
    *   **Source:** r/NvidiaStock - Reddit, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGArhcTYcH19KG4FyaimJ6ON21vz2iurI6NlfUSlPWo0GyO8_UrQaXoyu0UtKlrbmWMVJ136QiejF_DtLe3LYnKw48G0lVazqBkLDyGyn7C8cKmC8n_Y1vysxqTQ4mLRSFbG9dE
    *   **Impact:** High. This is highly material and non-consensus. The significant spread in gross margin expectations (58% vs. 65-72% vs. 71.1% consensus) suggests considerable uncertainty and potential for a surprise. The specific mention of GB300 ramp pressure and the 15% China license fee (50-60bps impact) provides concrete reasons for potential margin deviation.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is explicitly non-consensus, highlighting a wide divergence of expectations among survey respondents compared to the sell-side consensus. The 58% expectation from one-third of respondents is a significant outlier.

*   **Snippet:** "On the other hand, the Wall Street sentiment around Nvidia's upcoming earnings release is slightly more bearish since down revisions prevailed over upgrades over the last 90 days. This is a two-edged sword though, because beating conservative forecasts will be easier for NVDA."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While not a specific guidance number, this indicates a general sentiment shift that could lead to a more favorable "beat" scenario if the company performs well against lowered expectations.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This suggests a prevailing trend of down revisions, which could mean the current consensus is more conservative than it might have been, potentially creating a non-consensus opportunity for a positive surprise.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Q3 EPS:** There's a clear gap between Wedbush's specific Q3 FY2026 EPS estimate of $1.10 and the "some on the street" expectation of $1.25. This difference of $0.15 per share is material and represents a non-consensus opportunity.
*   **Gross Margins:** The most significant contradiction lies in the Q3 gross margin expectations. While the sell-side consensus is around 71.1%, a substantial portion of survey respondents anticipate margins as low as ~58%. This wide range, driven by concerns over GB300 ramps and China export fees, presents a critical non-consensus data point that could heavily influence market reaction.
*   **Revenue Guidance:** While an expectation of $55 billion for Q3 FY2026 revenue is mentioned, a specific consensus revenue estimate for Q3 FY2026 from a broad set of analysts in the last 24 hours was not explicitly found, making it harder to gauge the "non-consensus" nature of the $55 billion figure definitively against a tight timeframe. However, the overall FY2026 revenue consensus is $206.56B.

In summary, the most material non-consensus information for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings revolves around the potential for a higher Q3 FY2026 EPS guidance than some specific analyst estimates, and critically, the significant divergence in Q3 gross margin expectations due to new product ramps and export control impacts. Any clarity or deviation from these non-consensus views in NVIDIA's guidance will likely have a substantial impact on the stock.
