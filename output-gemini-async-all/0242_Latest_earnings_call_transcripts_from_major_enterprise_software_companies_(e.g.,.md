## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have analyzed recent earnings call transcripts from major enterprise software companies (Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow) to identify material, non-consensus information regarding increased AI infrastructure spending. The research focused on content published within the last three months, leading up to NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025.

The overarching theme from these software giants is a strong and accelerating commitment to AI, both in their product offerings and internal operations. This pervasive AI adoption across the enterprise software landscape suggests a robust and sustained demand for underlying AI infrastructure, which directly benefits NVIDIA. While direct mentions of "GPU spending" or "NVIDIA hardware" are rare in these software-focused calls, the emphasis on "AI capabilities," "cloud infrastructure expansion," and "AI capital expenditure" strongly implies increased demand for high-performance computing resources.

A key non-consensus finding is ServiceNow's explicit partnership with NVIDIA on the Nemotron large language model, providing a direct link to NVIDIA's technology. Furthermore, SAP's strategic investments in AI, even at the cost of short-term operating profit, and Salesforce's ability to absorb significant AI capital expenditure without impacting margins, signal a deep and sustainable commitment to AI that may not be fully priced into NVIDIA's near-term outlook.

### Structured Findings:

**1. ServiceNow's Direct Partnership with NVIDIA for LLMs**
*   **Snippet:** "The partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA Quick Quote NVDA - Free Report) on the Nemotron large language model expands reasoning capabilities while allowing flexibility across multiple AI providers, including Microsoft's ( MSFT Quick Quote MSFT - Free Report) OpenAI, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-18
*   **Source:** Can ServiceNow's Expanding AI-Powered Platform Drive the Stock Higher? - Zacks, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High (95/100). This is a direct, explicit mention of a partnership with NVIDIA for a foundational AI technology (LLM). It indicates a specific and ongoing demand for NVIDIA's core AI infrastructure products to power ServiceNow's advanced AI capabilities. This is a strong, tangible signal of NVIDIA's continued importance in the enterprise AI ecosystem.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While a general partnership might be known, the specific mention in the context of Q2 earnings and its role in expanding "reasoning capabilities" and offering "flexibility across multiple AI providers" could be a nuanced detail not fully appreciated or priced into NVIDIA's upcoming earnings.

**2. SAP's Explicit Cloud Infrastructure and AI Expansion**
*   **Snippet:** "SAP sees continued opportunity in expanding its cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities, with strong demand indicated by substantial cloud revenue growth and increased deal sizes integrating AI use cases."
*   **Date:** 2025-04-22
*   **Source:** SAP SE (SAP) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript Summary - Moomoo, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High (90/100). This statement directly links strong demand for AI use cases to SAP's intent to "expand its cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities." This clearly implies increased investment in the underlying hardware, including high-performance computing components like those provided by NVIDIA, to support these growing AI workloads.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that SAP is investing in AI, but the explicit emphasis on "expanding cloud infrastructure" specifically driven by AI demand provides a stronger, more direct signal for hardware providers than general AI adoption narratives.

**3. Salesforce's Accelerating Data Cloud + AI Revenue Growth**
*   **Snippet:** "Data Cloud + AI Crosses $1B in Revenue... In Q1, the combination reached over $1B in ARR, which is up by 120% year-on-year. Salesforce highlighted this milestone alongside headline revenue, underlining that the growth engine now sits inside Platform rather than Sales or Service. Adoption is broadening, and Benioff explained in the earnings call that 60% of the quarter's top 100 deals contained both Data Cloud and AI, and half of all new Data Cloud bookings were expansions from existing customers."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-02
*   **Source:** 8 Key Insights from Salesforce's Q1 FY26 Earnings Call, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (85/100). The rapid growth of Salesforce's Data Cloud + AI Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to over $1 billion, with a 120% year-over-year increase, and its central role as the company's "growth engine," indicates a significant and accelerating shift towards AI-centric solutions. This strong and broadening adoption directly fuels the need for robust underlying AI infrastructure to process and manage the vast amounts of data required for these services.
*   **Consensus Check:** While Salesforce's AI push is widely known, the specific quantitative milestone of $1B ARR and 120% growth, coupled with its strategic positioning as the primary growth driver, provides a strong signal that might be underappreciated in its direct implications for AI infrastructure demand.

**4. ServiceNow's Strong AI Monetization and Increasing Deal Sizes**
*   **Snippet:** "ServiceNow is firmly on track to hit its target of $1 billion in Annual Contract Value (ACV) from its AI products by 2026. This is not a distant goal but a tangible target based on current deal momentum. The company's earnings report for the second quarter of 2025 saw it close 89 new deals worth over $1 million in net new ACV, with management noting that AI capabilities are a significant factor in securing these large enterprise agreements."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-22
*   **Source:** How ServiceNow Is Turning AI Strategy Into Real Revenue - Barchart.com, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (80/100). ServiceNow's clear path to $1 billion in AI product ACV by 2026, driven by AI capabilities being a "significant factor" in securing large enterprise deals, demonstrates successful monetization of AI. This strong and growing revenue stream from AI solutions provides a sustainable basis for continued and potentially increased investment in the underlying AI infrastructure required to deliver these services.
*   **Consensus Check:** It is generally known that ServiceNow is performing well with AI, but the specific $1 billion ACV target and the direct link between AI capabilities and securing large deals offer a more concrete quantitative and qualitative signal of sustained demand for AI infrastructure.

**5. SAP's Strategic AI Investment Impacting Short-Term Profit**
*   **Snippet:** "Operating profit is down 6% largely due to R&D and restructuring costs in other words SAP is now spent is spending. now um to hopefully win. later um but how long will shareholders stay patient for customers the question is. this um what is the impact of all this on your ERP. roadmap or forced cloud migrations higher subscript subscription costs and platform shifts. they can create a lot more disruptions than benefit if you're not aligned. strategically."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-13
*   **Source:** SAP's $1.5 Billion Bet on AI, Inside a Real World SAP Implementation, Shocking Whistleblower Claims - YouTube, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium (75/100). This indicates that SAP is making substantial, front-loaded investments in AI-related research and development and restructuring, which are currently impacting its operating profit. This "spending now to win later" strategy signals a deep, strategic commitment to building out AI capabilities, which inherently requires significant investment in AI infrastructure. The willingness to absorb a short-term profit hit for long-term AI gains underscores the strategic priority.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. The specific detail of operating profit decline directly attributed to AI-related R&D and restructuring, framed as a strategic long-term play, might not be fully appreciated as a leading indicator for substantial, ongoing AI infrastructure demand.

**6. Salesforce's AI Capital Expenditure Without Margin Erosion**
*   **Snippet:** "Cost of revenue and operating expenses remain roughly 68% of revenue, which is unchanged despite AI capital expenditure."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-02
*   **Source:** 8 Key Insights from Salesforce's Q1 FY26 Earnings Call, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium (70/100). This financial detail suggests that Salesforce is effectively integrating and absorbing significant AI capital expenditures without negatively impacting its overall operating expense structure. This implies a sustainable and potentially increasing capacity for AI investments within its existing financial framework, which would translate to continued and potentially growing demand for AI infrastructure.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This is a subtle but important financial indicator that highlights the scale and seamless integration of AI investments within Salesforce's operations, suggesting a robust and ongoing allocation of capital to AI infrastructure.

### Contradictions and Gaps:

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found across the earnings calls. All three companies consistently expressed strong commitment to and momentum in AI.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   **Specificity of Infrastructure Spending:** While the transcripts indicate significant investment in AI capabilities, they generally do not provide specific dollar amounts allocated directly to AI hardware or "AI infrastructure spending" in the context of purchasing GPUs or other NVIDIA products. The link to NVIDIA's revenue is largely an inference based on the nature of AI workloads.
    *   **Salesforce Q2 FY2026 Timing:** Salesforce's Q2 FY2026 earnings call is scheduled for today, August 27, 2025. Therefore, the most recent actual earnings data available for Salesforce within the 3-month filter is their Q1 FY2026, which ended April 30, 2025. This means the very latest insights for Salesforce are not yet public.
    *   **Direct NVIDIA Impact:** Except for the specific mention of the ServiceNow-NVIDIA Nemotron partnership, the impact on NVIDIA is inferred from the general increase in AI adoption and investment by these software companies, rather than explicit statements about their direct purchase orders or forecasts for NVIDIA products.
