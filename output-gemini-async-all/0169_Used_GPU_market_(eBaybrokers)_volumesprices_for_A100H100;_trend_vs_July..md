## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on NVIDIA's (NVDA) GPU market, focusing on material, non-consensus information from the used GPU market (eBay/brokers) for A100/H100, and trends versus July 2025.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is reporting Q2 FY2026 earnings today, and while the primary market for its cutting-edge H100 and upcoming B200 GPUs is widely discussed, the secondary and gray markets offer crucial, often overlooked insights into underlying demand, supply dynamics, and the longevity of older generation products.

A significant non-consensus finding is the robust and evolving gray market in China for banned NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs. Despite export restrictions, repair services for these high-demand chips are thriving, with costs up to $2,800 per card, indicating a strong, albeit illicit, demand for these powerful accelerators. This suggests that a substantial installed base of NVIDIA's previous-generation chips continues to operate and requires maintenance, indirectly reflecting the enduring value and necessity of these GPUs in regions with limited access to new hardware. The recent ban on NVIDIA's H20 accelerator in China has further fueled this secondary market, leading to a surge of second-hand A100 and H100 GPUs being repurposed, primarily for inference workloads. This shift in supply-demand dynamics in a critical market like China could influence global secondary market pricing and availability.

Regarding pricing and volume trends, while new H100s commanded high prices in early 2025 (up to $35,000 for premium PCIe units, and secondary market listings starting near $40,000), there's evidence of price corrections in the Chinese black market for H100-equipped servers as of May 2024 (the most recent specific data for this market). This decline, attributed to improving supply and anticipation of the H200, suggests that even in constrained markets, the prospect of newer, more powerful chips can temper the extreme premiums on current-generation hardware. However, the overall demand for H100s remains exceptionally high, with enterprise pre-orders facing significant lead times and secondary market units selling quickly.

Crucially, the continued demand for A100 and H100 GPUs for *inference* workloads, even as newer chips like the H200 emerge, presents a material insight. Cloud providers like CoreWeave are re-contracting older A100/H100 clusters for 1-3 years, primarily for inference. This indicates that these GPUs, while not the absolute latest for training, retain significant value and generate sustained revenue streams in the long term. The A100, in particular, remains a cost-effective option for prototyping, fine-tuning, and small-scale training, with cloud rental rates significantly lower than H100s. This extended lifecycle and repurposing of older GPUs could provide a more stable, recurring revenue component for NVIDIA's ecosystem, beyond the initial sales of the newest chips.

In summary, while the market is focused on the H100's primary sales and the upcoming B200, the robust gray market in China, the repurposing of older GPUs for inference, and the nuanced pricing trends in secondary markets highlight a deeper, more complex demand picture that could offer resilience and extended revenue opportunities for NVIDIA.

**Structured Findings:**

**1. Thriving Gray Market for Banned A100/H100 GPUs in China**
- **Snippet:** "Shenzhen workshops are quietly repairing gray-market Nvidia H100 and A100 accelerators banned under Washington's export restrictions. With GPUs running flat-out in AI clusters and failure rates climbing, repair jobs fetching up to $2800 per card reveal a thriving underground service ecosystem."
- **Date:** July 28, 2025
- **Source:** Vertex AI Search (citing an article about gray-market repairs)
- **Impact:** High. This indicates persistent, strong demand for NVIDIA's previous-generation high-end GPUs in a key market (China) despite export bans. The existence of a robust repair ecosystem suggests these chips are actively being used and maintained, implying a larger installed base and continued utility, which could translate to long-term software and ecosystem revenue for NVIDIA, even if direct hardware sales are restricted. This is non-consensus as it highlights an underground economy not typically factored into official forecasts.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Mainstream analysis often focuses on direct sales and export restrictions, not the downstream gray market for repairs and continued usage.

**2. Surge in Second-Hand A100/H100 GPUs in China Due to H20 Ban, Repurposed for Inference**
- **Snippet:** "China's AI hardware market is facing an unexpected shake-up after authorities banned Nvidia's H20 accelerator, prompting a surge of second-hand AI training systems from overseas. Industry sources report that large volumes of retired high-end gear, particularly Nvidia A100 and H100 GPUs, are being stripped down and repurposed for inference, altering supply-demand balances and adding volatility to global supply chains."
- **Date:** August 27, 2025
- **Source:** DIGITIMES Asia (via Vertex AI Search)
- **Impact:** High. The H20 ban and subsequent repurposing of A100/H100s for inference in China is a recent development that significantly impacts the secondary market. This suggests a sustained, albeit shifted, demand for these chips, potentially extending their economic life and influencing global secondary market prices. It also highlights the growing importance of inference workloads for older-generation GPUs.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The direct consequence of the H20 ban on the *secondary market* for A100/H100s and their specific repurposing for inference is likely not fully integrated into consensus estimates.

**3. Continued Demand for A100/H100 Clusters for Inference Workloads**
- **Snippet:** "Management said H100/A100 clusters rolling off initial terms are being 're-contracted for 1–3 years', largely for inference; and some anchor contracts (e.g., OpenAI) include 'extension options'. That's the economic hedge against generational turnover - older gear shifts to inference and continues earning, rather than becoming an impairment risk."
- **Date:** August 25, 2025
- **Source:** Seeking Alpha (analyzing CoreWeave's Q2 2025 10Q)
- **Impact:** Medium-High. This indicates a durable demand for existing A100 and H100 infrastructure for inference, even as newer chips are released. This extends the revenue-generating lifespan of these GPUs for cloud providers and suggests a more stable, recurring revenue stream for NVIDIA's ecosystem (e.g., software, support) beyond initial hardware sales. This counters a potential consensus view that older GPUs quickly become obsolete.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general demand for AI is known, the specific trend of re-contracting older GPU clusters for inference for multi-year terms is a nuanced detail that may not be fully priced in.

**4. Price Correction in China's H100 Black Market Due to H200 Anticipation**
- **Snippet:** "Anticipating slowing demand for H100, scalpers have begun to rapidly unload their stocks, the report says. This in turn led to a swift price correction in the market, with the cost of H100-equipped servers plummeting to about ¥2.7 to ¥2.8 million in mainland China — and even lower in Hong Kong, to around ¥2.6 million, according to the report."
- **Date:** May 1, 2024 (Note: This is older data, but provides a trend for how new chip announcements impact the secondary market, which is relevant for current H200/B200 anticipation.)
- **Source:** Tom's Hardware (citing TrendForce and Economic Daily News)
- **Impact:** Medium. While the date is older, this snippet illustrates a critical dynamic: the anticipation of newer GPUs (H200 in this case) can lead to significant price drops in the secondary/black market for the current generation (H100). This suggests that while demand for H100 remains high, the impending release of B200 could exert downward pressure on H100 secondary market prices, potentially impacting NVIDIA's pricing power or the perceived value of its current flagship.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known in terms of general market dynamics, but the specific magnitude and speed of the "plummeting" prices in the black market due to anticipation of a new chip might be overlooked in broader financial models.

**5. Significant Price Disparity and Continued Value of A100 in Secondary Market/Cloud Rentals**
- **Snippet:** "The NVIDIA A100 80GB price 2025 is between $9,500 and $14,000 depending on the vendor, new or refurbished condition, and accompanying hardware like active or passive cooling options."
- **Snippet:** "Unless your workload truly needs H100 features (Transformer Engine, higher bandwidth, etc.), the A100 often delivers the best ROI for prototyping, fine-tuning, and small-scale training."
- **Snippet:** "Thunder Compute's A100 rate is 4–8× cheaper than AWS or GCP and ≈2× cheaper than Azure, while its A100 remains the absolute price-performance leader."
- **Date:** May 23, 2025, May 19, 2025
- **Source:** Direct Macro, NVIDIA H100 Pricing (August 2025): Cheapest On-Demand Cloud GPU Rates - Cyfuture Cloud
- **Impact:** Medium. The A100, despite being an older generation, maintains a significant market value in the secondary market and offers a much more cost-effective solution for many AI workloads through cloud rentals. This indicates that not all AI demand requires the absolute latest and most expensive hardware, suggesting a broader and more diversified market for NVIDIA's older-generation chips. This could provide a buffer against potential oversupply of the very latest chips.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While H100's dominance is well-known, the sustained and cost-effective utility of the A100 for specific workloads, particularly in the cloud rental market, might be underestimated.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradiction:** While some sources indicate H100 supply is still tight and secondary market units sell fast, the May 2024 report on plummeting black market prices in China due to H200 anticipation suggests a potential easing of extreme scarcity in *some* segments or a rapid shift in demand ahead of new product cycles. This isn't a direct contradiction but highlights regional and temporal nuances.
*   **Gap:** Specific, real-time (July-August 2025) volume data for A100/H100 sales on platforms like eBay or through brokers is difficult to ascertain from the provided snippets. Most pricing information is either from early 2025 or refers to trends rather than concrete July/August transaction volumes.
*   **Gap:** Detailed information on the *quality* or *condition* of used GPUs in the secondary market (beyond general mentions of "condition and warranty status") and how that impacts pricing and demand is limited. The repair market in China hints at potential quality issues, but specifics are lacking.
