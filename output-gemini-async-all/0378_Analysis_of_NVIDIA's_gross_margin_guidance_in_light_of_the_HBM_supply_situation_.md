## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, my analysis of NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report (quarter ending July 2025) reveals several material, non-consensus factors related to HBM supply and China revenue mix that are likely to impact gross margin guidance. The most significant non-consensus information points to an escalating challenge in the China market, where even compliant chips are reportedly being rejected, alongside persistent tightness and strong pricing in the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) market.

While NVIDIA has previously guided for a non-GAAP gross margin of around 72%, the confluence of these factors suggests potential headwinds that could pressure this outlook. The China situation, in particular, appears to be worsening beyond initial expectations of U.S. export restrictions, with Chinese regulators reportedly taking action against NVIDIA's compliant H20 chips. This, combined with the strong pricing power of HBM suppliers due to sold-out capacity, could lead to a more challenging gross margin environment than widely anticipated.

***

### Structured Findings:

**1. China Reportedly Rejecting NVIDIA's Compliant H20 Chips**
*   **Snippet:** "Chinese regulators have reportedly ordered large tech companies to suspend purchases of Nvidia's H20 GPUs, according to The Information, in what would be the latest chapter in the artificial intelligence chip saga between the U.S. and China. If before this news piece, we were talking about the U.S. ban, which was setting the floor on the revenues from China, now China itself seems to be rejecting the compliant chips. It looks like a dangerous shift in future earnings visibility, as the risk is no longer just coming from Washington—it's now coming from Beijing."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-13
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** High. This is a critical, potentially non-consensus development. The rejection of NVIDIA's specifically designed, compliant H20 chips by Chinese regulators signifies a significant escalation of geopolitical risk and could lead to a near-total loss of the Chinese AI accelerator market for NVIDIA. This directly impacts revenue and, given the likely lower margins on compliant chips, could further pressure overall gross margins.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While the impact of U.S. export restrictions on China sales is known, China *itself* actively rejecting NVIDIA's compliant chips is a newer, less widely discussed development that materially changes the China outlook and is likely not fully priced into consensus models.

**2. Quantified Q2 H20 Revenue Headwind from China**
*   **Snippet:** "In the Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue. Note, our outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion for the second quarter."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-13
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha (citing NVIDIA's Q1 earnings call outlook for Q2)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a specific, quantified revenue loss of $8 billion directly impacting the current quarter's earnings. While this figure was part of NVIDIA's previous guidance, its significance is amplified by the recent reports of China's active rejection of H20 chips, suggesting this headwind may persist or worsen.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known (from NVIDIA's own guidance), but the *implications* in conjunction with China's reported rejection of H20s (as per finding 1) might be underappreciated, potentially leading to a miss on the lower end of guidance or a more cautious forward outlook.

**3. Significant Erosion of NVIDIA's China Market Share**
*   **Snippet:** "Estimates project that the U.S. export curbs (including the new “AI diffusion” controls) will cost Nvidia ~$5.5 billion annually in lost China sales. Additionally, Chinese firms like Huawei, Alibaba and Biren have accelerated their AI-chip programs in response, driving Nvidia's market share in China from ~95% pre-ban to ~50% today."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-27
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** Medium-High. This snippet quantifies the long-term impact of U.S. restrictions and the rapid rise of local competition on NVIDIA's market share and revenue potential in China. A drop from 95% to 50% is substantial and indicates a permanent shift in the competitive landscape, which could lead to sustained lower revenue and potentially lower margins from the China region.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known (general competition in China), but the specific, dramatic decline in market share to ~50% as of May 2025 might be more severe than widely acknowledged or fully factored into long-term models.

**4. HBM Supply Sold Out for 2025 with Contracted Pricing**
*   **Snippet:** "Micron's HBM production is sold out for all of 2025, and management hinted that they're already in active discussions with customers about 2026 supply agreements. When customers invest hundreds of millions of dollars and months of engineering time to qualify a particular HBM solution, they're not making switching decisions based on minor price differences. This allows Micron to have exceptional revenue visibility and they have already sold out their HBM production for all of 2025. As AI workloads are moving beyond just training large language models to include inference, edge computing and specialized applications, the number of companies requiring HBM is growing rapidly."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-16
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha (based on Micron's Q2 FY25 earnings call context)
*   **Impact:** High. This indicates a sustained tight supply and strong pricing power for HBM suppliers like Micron. As NVIDIA is a major consumer of HBM for its AI GPUs (e.g., GB200, GB300), this translates to higher input costs (COGS) for NVIDIA. The inability of customers to switch easily due to qualification costs suggests NVIDIA has limited leverage on HBM pricing, which could put downward pressure on NVIDIA's gross margins.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known (HBM tightness is a general theme), but the extent of "sold out for all of 2025" with "pricing already contracted" and the explicit statement about customers "not making switching decisions based on minor price differences" provides a strong, specific indication of sustained high HBM costs that might not be fully reflected in consensus gross margin models for NVIDIA.

### Contradictions and Gaps:

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found among the selected snippets. However, the market narrative often focuses on the strong demand for NVIDIA's AI chips, which these findings temper with significant supply-side cost pressures (HBM) and demand-side geopolitical risks (China).
*   **Gaps:** While the tightness of HBM supply and strong pricing power of suppliers are evident, specific *quantified increases* in HBM costs for NVIDIA are not provided. This makes it challenging to precisely model the direct impact on NVIDIA's gross margin percentage. Similarly, the exact gross margin profile of NVIDIA's China-specific chips (like H20) versus its higher-end, unrestricted chips is not detailed, making it difficult to fully assess the margin dilution from the shift in China revenue mix.
