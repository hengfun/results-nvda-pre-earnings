## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have identified several material, non-consensus pieces of information regarding HBM3E contract prices and supply chain dynamics that are likely to impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The information is filtered to content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025).

Here are the key findings:

### Structured Findings

**Finding 1: Significant HBM Price Increases Expected for Q3 2025, Exacerbated by US Tariffs**

*   **Snippet:** "Need from AI boosters is also pushing up the cost of High-Speed Memory (HBM), with prices set to go up by 15% to 20% in Q3 2025. This is a big jump from the 5% to 10% growth before, likely because of the start of producing more like Nvidia's B300-series AI GPUs, which use a lot of HBM3E memory. ... The United States will start charging 25% import taxes on memory products from Japan and South Korea from August 1st. This will surely push the prices of all consumer and server memory types up more, adding to the jumps TrendForce expects to see."
*   **Date:** July 8, 2025
*   **Source:** Technetbook, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFZw0dYAeh_xP8rkFU--TCtKbqYr-vjx0lEl_aY6lSUc_qxPyViLJk_Ds42rZmAl58FJWUA4MUGyZ2fGaxKyuN6up-vV0xB5zJxOwCjlcbdFdydHbr1SlFnn8BG54epX-cn1oNnEKog3SW1YNiQnhbb9S0sdeQQsvcvsj8HbGoQCWERd6wlaErbtJw=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFZw0dYAeh_xP8rkFU--TCtKbqYr-vjx0lEl_aY6lSUc_qxPyViLJk_Ds42rZmAl58FJWUA4MUGyZ2fGaxKyuN6up-vV0xB5zJxOwCjlcbdFdydHbr1SlFnn8BG54epX-cn1oNnEKog3SW1YNiQnhbb9S0sdeQQsvcvsj8HbGoQCWERd6wlaErbtJw=)
*   **Impact:** High. A 15-20% increase in HBM prices for Q3 2025, on top of existing growth, directly impacts NVIDIA's cost of goods sold for its B300-series AI GPUs. The additional 25% US import tariffs from August 1st further compounds this cost pressure, potentially squeezing gross margins in Q3 FY2026 and influencing forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** While general HBM demand and price increases are known, the specific magnitude (15-20% jump) and the direct impact of the new US tariffs from August 1st are likely less widely factored into current consensus estimates for NVIDIA's Q3 FY2026.

**Finding 2: NVIDIA in Price Negotiation Deadlock with SK Hynix, Samsung Offering Significantly Lower HBM3E Prices**

*   **Snippet:** "Industry observers believe that ongoing deadlock in supply and price negotiations between NVIDIA and SK hynix is due to Samsung's imminent delivery. ... Samsung is reported to have proposed an HBM3E supply price for the H20 that is 20-30% lower than SK hynix. Accordingly, NVIDIA is insisting on confirming the quality of Samsung's HBM3E and HBM4 before finalizing price agreements with SK hynix."

*   **Impact:** Very High. This is a critical non-consensus data point. If NVIDIA successfully qualifies Samsung's HBM3E and secures a 20-30% lower price, it could significantly offset the general HBM price increases and positively impact NVIDIA's gross margins for future quarters (Q3 FY2026 and beyond), especially for its China-bound H20 chips and potentially broader HBM3E procurement. The "deadlock" with SK Hynix suggests a strong negotiation stance by NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** This specific negotiation dynamic and Samsung's aggressive pricing are likely non-consensus and could be a significant upside driver for NVIDIA's margins if successful.

**Finding 3: HBM3E Supply Remains Extremely Tight, Micron's 2025 Capacity Fully Booked**

*   **Snippet:** "Micron's HBM supply is sold out for 2025. In fact, the HBM growth was so strong that its revenue rose nearly 50% sequentially. ... Micron expects its global HBM market share to be nearly equal to its DRAM share, which is between 20% and 25%, in the second half of 2025. ... HBM demand is set to outpace overall DRAM growth, creating tight supply conditions."

*   **Impact:** High. The confirmation that a major HBM supplier like Micron has its 2025 HBM capacity fully booked, coupled with strong sequential revenue growth and overall tight supply, indicates sustained high HBM prices. This reinforces the cost pressure on NVIDIA, especially for Q2 FY2026 and subsequent quarters, and could limit upside from volume if supply cannot keep pace with demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** While tight HBM supply is generally acknowledged, the explicit "sold out for 2025" from a key supplier like Micron, and the magnitude of their HBM revenue growth, might be more specific than widely known.

**Finding 4: NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 Gross Margin Recovery Anticipated After Q1 Dip**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia is scheduled to report Q2 FY2026 (quarter ended July 27, 2025) after the close on Wednesday, with an earnings call at 5:00 p.m. ET. Management guided to approximately $45.0 billion in revenue, plus or minus 2%, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins of about 71.8% and 72.0% (±50 bps). ... Gross margins suffered significantly last quarter [Q1 FY2026], recovery to 71.8% is anticipated as management targets mid-70% margins despite operational headwinds."

*   **Impact:** High. This sets the expectation for NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 gross margins. Any deviation, positively or negatively, from this 71.8-72.0% range due to HBM pricing or supply could significantly impact the stock. The recovery from Q1's 60.5% margin (due to China H20 charge) makes the HBM cost management in Q2 even more critical.
*   **Consensus Check:** NVIDIA's own guidance and analyst expectations for Q2 margins are generally known. The underlying factors, like HBM pricing, are what drive deviations from this consensus.

**Finding 5: Potential for HBM Price Drop in 2026, but Next-Gen HBM Prices Still Expected to Rise**

*   **Snippet:** "Goldman Sachs reports that rising competition and oversupply could trigger the first HBM price drop in 2026—posing a challenge for market leader SK hynix. Notably, according to Goldman Sachs, HBM prices could see a double-digit drop in 2026. ... Considering the release of next-gen HBM, overall average HBM prices are still expected to trend upward, according to TrendForce. ... Goldman Sachs highlights that NVIDIA's next-gen GPU, Rubin, won't boost its HBM content compared to B300. Both will use 288GB—Rubin with HBM4 12Hi, B300 with HBM3E 12Hi."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While primarily impacting 2026, this could influence NVIDIA's forward guidance. A potential double-digit price drop in 2026 could be a tailwind for NVIDIA's margins, but the caveat that next-gen HBM (HBM4 for Rubin) prices are still expected to trend upward means the benefit might be limited to older HBM generations. The lack of increased HBM content in Rubin compared to B300 suggests demand growth might be more about volume than per-GPU content.
*   **Consensus Check:** The risk of an HBM price drop in 2026 is likely not fully priced into NVIDIA's long-term outlook, as the market is currently focused on tight supply and rising prices. The nuance between older and next-gen HBM pricing is also important.

**Finding 6: TSMC Packaging Bottleneck Could Influence NVIDIA's HBM Strategy for China-Specific Chips**

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC's packaging capacity is a bottleneck; higher ASPs from advanced packaging services could drive margin expansion if the B30s use HBM. On the negative side, overseas fab expansions in the US and Japan will pressure margins for the next 5 years due to higher labor costs and operational dilution. ... Some sources pointed out that Nvidia could go with a GDDR configuration for the B30s to avoid pressuring the higher-spec Blackwell ramp in TSMC's packaging division."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While not directly about HBM3E *price changes*, this highlights a critical supply chain bottleneck (TSMC advanced packaging) that could force NVIDIA to make strategic decisions about memory types (HBM vs. GDDR) for certain products, particularly for the China market (B30/B30A). If NVIDIA opts for GDDR to alleviate packaging pressure, it could impact performance and potentially average selling prices, indirectly affecting overall margins. Conversely, if B30s do use HBM, higher ASPs for advanced packaging could benefit TSMC, but also represent a cost for NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** The specific details of NVIDIA's memory strategy for China-specific chips and the direct link to TSMC's packaging bottleneck are likely overlooked by many investors, who might assume HBM is universally applied.

---

### Contradictions and Gaps

*   **Contradiction:** There's a slight tension between the general TrendForce forecast for HBM price increases in Q3 2025 and the Goldman Sachs/TrendForce view on potential 2026 price drops for HBM. This suggests a near-term cost headwind but a potential longer-term tailwind, with the distinction likely lying in the generation of HBM.
*   **Gap:** While Samsung is reportedly offering lower HBM3E prices, there's no clear indication of when NVIDIA expects to complete the qualification process for Samsung's HBM3E and HBM4. The timing of this qualification is crucial for when NVIDIA could start realizing potential cost savings.
*   **Gap:** The impact of the 25% US import tariffs on memory products from Japan and South Korea is noted as pushing prices up, but the precise magnitude of this impact on NVIDIA's overall HBM cost structure is not quantified.
*   **Gap:** The extent to which NVIDIA's current Q2 FY2026 gross margin guidance (71.8-72.0%) already incorporates the anticipated HBM price increases for Q3 2025 and the potential for competitive pricing from Samsung is unclear. Management commentary during the earnings call will be key to understanding this.
