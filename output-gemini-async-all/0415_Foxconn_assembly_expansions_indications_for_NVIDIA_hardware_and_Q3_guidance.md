## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into its supply chain, particularly Foxconn's assembly operations, reveals several material and potentially non-consensus insights that could significantly impact the company's forward-looking guidance. Recent reports indicate a robust and accelerating demand for NVIDIA's AI hardware, with Foxconn, a key manufacturing partner, making aggressive moves to expand its production capacity.

While the market generally anticipates strong performance from NVIDIA, the granular details from Foxconn's recent financial disclosures and strategic shifts suggest an even more bullish outlook for NVIDIA's AI server shipments and revenue than might be widely factored into current consensus estimates. However, some contrasting signals from other server partners like Super Micro highlight potential segmentation or varying impacts of supply chain dynamics.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Foxconn's third-quarter 2025 AI server revenue growth of over 170% year-on-year is not just a financial milestone—it is a seismic shift in the global technology manufacturing landscape. This surge reflects a broader inflection point where AI infrastructure is becoming the new backbone of the digital economy. For investors, the numbers tell a compelling story: Foxconn's AI server business now accounts for 50% of its total server revenue, with gross margins 10–15% higher than its traditional consumer electronics segment."

    *   **Source:** The Good Investors, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHSaCF5hNObWNZZDqjkWIDJM9jCqhvIld9nbdQTbIrX8GuWt3aYo53585n1JQ6SKmrKAV-IqnfpdzxwLeDEc08sjbaCfzIKPTByhlvKbUjkjmozfsuN3OFl0m4ONwyH-Wjc82QWm5Q6Wp_RRi_Rxxji-_01P2CRBBLzVZwMyTqlT0R_w2n9ackn_nvXIAU0yDvZ_3g_F6at4DBPnNsZ6p8kh_Ga1n6iDxKg5Os=
    *   **Impact:** High. Foxconn's projected 170% YoY growth in AI server revenue for Q3 2025, coupled with its increasing share of total revenue and higher margins in this segment, strongly indicates sustained and accelerating demand for NVIDIA's AI hardware. This specific, forward-looking data from a major partner suggests a potentially stronger revenue trajectory for NVIDIA than currently anticipated.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Foxconn's overall strength in AI servers is known, the magnitude of this specific Q3 2025 projection and its implications for Foxconn's business mix and profitability may not be fully priced into NVIDIA's stock.

*   **Snippet:** "Foxconn is the sole assembler of NVIDIA's GB200 servers."

    *   **Impact:** High. This detail highlights a critical and exclusive relationship for NVIDIA's next-generation GB200 servers. Foxconn's capacity and performance directly dictate NVIDIA's ability to deliver its most advanced AI platforms, making Foxconn's bullish outlook even more significant for NVIDIA's future revenue.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Foxconn is recognized as a major NVIDIA partner, its exclusive role as the GB200 assembler might not be widely known, implying a tighter supply chain control and potentially more predictable ramp for NVIDIA's latest offerings.

*   **Snippet:** "Foxconn's plan to build factories in Houston, Texas — part of Nvidia's $500 billion U.S. investment plan — and in Mexico to produce AI servers for the U.S. client underscores this strategy, analysts said. Foxconn now expects its AI server revenue would grow more than 170% in the third quarter year-on-year."

    *   **Impact:** High. This confirms Foxconn's active and geographically diversified expansion for NVIDIA AI servers, directly linking to NVIDIA's substantial US investment. The reiteration of the 170% Q3 growth further solidifies the positive outlook for NVIDIA's hardware demand and supply.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. NVIDIA's broader US investment plans are known, but the specific details of Foxconn's dedicated factory expansions in Houston and Mexico for NVIDIA AI servers, and their direct contribution to the strong Q3 growth, might be under-appreciated.

*   **Snippet:** "We do know, as Barron's has reported, that Foxconn, which is a large manufacturer of AI-capable servers for Nvidia is projecting 170% revenue growth in the sales of these servers for the current quarter. Sales of these racks are expected to triple from one quarter to the next. That means Nvidia is spending. One would think that to spend like that, Huang must have the orders in place. Right?"

    *   **Impact:** High. This snippet, published on the day of NVIDIA's earnings, provides a highly material and specific data point: "Sales of these racks are expected to triple from one quarter to the next." This indicates a massive acceleration in volume for NVIDIA's AI server racks, strongly implying robust, confirmed orders that could lead to a significant beat on guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. The "triple from one quarter to the next" for rack shipments is a very strong, granular volume indicator that is likely not fully incorporated into consensus estimates, especially being highlighted so close to the earnings release.

*   **Snippet:** "Even more surprising was Foxconn's outlook, which indicates Foxconn is expecting AI server shipments to significantly accelerate in the next 3-6 months: AI server revenue is expected to increase more than 170% year-over-year, with rack shipments growing threefold quarter-over-quarter, reflecting continued strong demand from customers and stable production optimisation."

    *   **Impact:** High. This reiterates the "threefold quarter-over-quarter" rack shipment growth and emphasizes the acceleration over the "next 3-6 months," providing a strong forward-looking signal for NVIDIA's Q3 and potentially Q4 FY2026. The mention of "stable production optimisation" also positively addresses potential supply chain bottlenecks.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. The specific "threefold quarter-over-quarter" growth in rack shipments, combined with the "stable production optimisation," offers a more optimistic and detailed view of NVIDIA's near-term volume capabilities than may be generally understood.

*   **Snippet:** "Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, has agreed to sell its Ohio electric vehicle (EV) plant for US$375 million to Crescent Dune LLC, according to exchange filings on August 4, 2025. ... A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg the company plans to use the plant for AI server production, a shift from its earlier EV focus. Hon Hai is a major server production partner for Nvidia and has expanded AI server assembly in the US."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-05
    *   **Source:** Tech in Asia, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFz0DDsyF_3HHRkEc7ZPYjMwoxZfiThpiaGCOrq6KtK8-ARMwXXHrg4Bf4RI20WGrcQjaFNh0VfqsMvtdmarCTajfqiQMxcvYVxJwi7N3Uhenb0qKPuoIlUUUrbVMSHaztXvb11UZ1RcrmNwhTNszDuUbquWMsw2VXluxspdqZQUUrnmft7SegTqsMEXuBddB8j9w==
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This strategic pivot by Foxconn, repurposing a significant asset (an EV plant) for AI server production for NVIDIA in the US, underscores the long-term commitment and aggressive capacity expansion dedicated to NVIDIA's AI hardware.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While Foxconn's general shift towards AI servers is known, the specific detail of divesting an EV plant to reallocate resources to NVIDIA AI server production in the US might be a less widely discussed indicator of their strategic alignment and capacity build-out.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

A notable contradiction arises when comparing Foxconn's extremely bullish outlook with the recent disappointing guidance from Super Micro Computer. Snippets and indicate that Super Micro's Q4 results and FY2026 outlook were underwhelming, with the company lagging peers like Foxconn in AI server growth and facing inventory and margin pressures. This divergence could suggest a market segmentation where Foxconn, as the "sole assembler" of NVIDIA's GB200 servers, is securing the most advanced and high-volume orders, while other partners might be dealing with older inventory or serving different customer tiers. NVIDIA's commentary on the overall health of its partner ecosystem and any potential bottlenecks or shifts in demand across different server manufacturers will be crucial for investors to understand.

Additionally, while NVIDIA's Q2 guidance already accounts for an $8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue due to China export controls, the potential for future China sales remains a point of uncertainty. Some reports hint at a possible "15% cut of revenue" deal with the Trump administration that could re-enable some China sales in the October quarter. However, this is highly speculative and subject to geopolitical volatility, which Foxconn's diversification plans (US, Mexico) partly aim to mitigate.
