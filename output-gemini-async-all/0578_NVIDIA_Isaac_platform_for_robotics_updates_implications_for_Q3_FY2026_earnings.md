**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **China Export Restrictions:** While not directly related to Isaac, the ongoing impact of China export restrictions and the new revenue-sharing agreement with the US government (15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China) could introduce volatility and impact overall revenue, even if the robotics segment performs strongly. This is a known headwind that could temper overall enthusiasm.
*   **Market Volatility in Robotics:** One source mentions that "Teradyne Robotics reported a 17% year-over-year revenue decline in Q2 2025, reflecting global market volatility." This suggests that while NVIDIA's robotics segment is growing rapidly, the broader robotics market can be subject to fluctuations, which could pose a risk to NVIDIA's long-term projections if not managed effectively.
*   **Specific Isaac Revenue Contribution:** While the Automotive and Robotics segment revenue is provided ($567 million in Q1 2025, 72% YoY growth), specific revenue figures directly attributable to the Isaac platform or its individual components are not explicitly broken out in the search results. This makes it challenging to precisely quantify Isaac's direct financial impact.

In conclusion, the recent updates on NVIDIA's Isaac platform, particularly the general availability of Jetson Thor, the significant growth in its developer ecosystem, and strategic partnerships, indicate strong underlying momentum in the robotics segment. The shift towards RaaS models and high-value niche applications like cognitive spacecraft further solidify its long-term potential. While the overall market and China export restrictions present some headwinds, the accelerating growth in robotics, coupled with bullish analyst expectations, suggests that NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and forward guidance could highlight the increasing importance and financial contribution of its physical AI initiatives.
