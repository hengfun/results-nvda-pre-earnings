## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report, based on recent web content. The findings highlight significant AI data center build-outs and GPU deployments, particularly in the Saudi Arabian market, which could indicate stronger-than-anticipated demand for NVIDIA's products.

### Human-Readable Analysis

Recent industry reports, specifically focusing on the Saudi Arabian data center market, reveal substantial AI infrastructure investments and significant GPU shipments that occurred within NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 (quarter ending July 2025). A key finding indicates that NVIDIA shipped 18,000 Blackwell GPUs to HUMAIN in May 2025 as part of a USD 10 billion AI data center build-out targeting 500 MW capacity. This is a highly material, specific data point that suggests robust demand for NVIDIA's latest generation GPUs from a single, large customer. Such a large, specific order and deployment within the reporting quarter could lead to an upside surprise in NVIDIA's data center revenue.

Furthermore, a USD 20 billion collaboration between Supermicro and DataVolt, launched in May 2025, focuses on GPU platforms with direct liquid cooling. While not directly naming NVIDIA, Supermicro is a primary partner for NVIDIA's GPU servers, and the emphasis on GPU platforms and advanced cooling strongly implies future demand for high-performance NVIDIA GPUs. This collaboration, if it translates into orders within the near future, could signal a strong pipeline for NVIDIA beyond the immediate quarter.

While there's also news of Qualcomm signing an MoU with HUMAIN to co-develop data-center AI silicon, this represents a longer-term strategic move for HUMAIN and is unlikely to impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings. However, it's a development to monitor for potential future competitive dynamics. The overall market trend in Saudi Arabia shows AI/ML workloads leading market revenue, driven by sovereign AI initiatives and large GPU deployments, reinforcing the strong demand environment for NVIDIA's offerings in the region.

### Structured Findings

**1. Snippet:** "May 2025: NVIDIA shipped 18,000 Blackwell GPUs to HUMAIN under a USD 10 billion AI data-center build-out targeting 500 MW capacity."
*   **Date:** June 20, 2025 (reporting on an event in May 2025)
*   **Source:** Saudi Arabia Data Center Server Market Size & Trends Analysis 2025 – 2030, Vertex AI Search Grounding API Redirect
*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, substantial shipment of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs (18,000 units) to a specific customer (HUMAIN) for a massive 500 MW AI data center project. The shipment occurred in May 2025, falling squarely within NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026, making it highly material for the upcoming earnings report. The scale of the build-out (USD 10 billion) underscores the significance of this demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While large deals are generally known, the specific quantity of 18,000 Blackwell GPUs to a particular entity like HUMAIN, and the associated 500 MW capacity, are highly granular details that are unlikely to be fully factored into broad analyst consensus models, especially from a niche regional market report.

**2. Snippet:** "May 2025: Supermicro and DataVolt launched a USD 20 billion collaboration covering GPU platforms cooled via direct liquid loops and powered by renewable energy."
*   **Date:** June 20, 2025 (reporting on an event in May 2025)
*   **Source:** Saudi Arabia Data Center Server Market Size & Trends Analysis 2025 – 2030, Vertex AI Search Grounding API Redirect
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Supermicro is a key partner for NVIDIA's GPU server solutions. A USD 20 billion collaboration focused on GPU platforms, particularly with direct liquid cooling (essential for high-density AI GPUs), strongly implies significant future demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. While not a direct NVIDIA order, it signals a robust pipeline for NVIDIA's ecosystem partners, potentially leading to future orders that could be reflected in forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. A USD 20 billion collaboration is significant, but its direct implications for NVIDIA's specific revenue recognition and future order book might not be fully integrated into consensus estimates, especially given the report's regional focus.

**3. Snippet:** "May 2025: Qualcomm signed an MoU with HUMAIN to co-develop data-center AI silicon and announced a Riyadh design office."
*   **Date:** June 20, 2025 (reporting on an event in May 2025)
*   **Source:** Saudi Arabia Data Center Server Market Size & Trends Analysis 2025 – 2030, Vertex AI Search Grounding API Redirect
*   **Impact:** Low. This is an MoU for co-development of AI silicon, indicating a potential long-term strategic shift or diversification for HUMAIN. However, it is unlikely to have any material impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings, as it's a future-oriented development rather than an immediate competitive threat or revenue impact. It's a point to monitor for future quarters.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This specific MoU is unlikely to be a primary focus for NVIDIA analysts in the immediate pre-earnings context.

**4. Snippet:** "AI/ML workloads lead with 37.1% of market revenue in 2024; virtualization and private cloud workloads show the highest forecast CAGR at 10.8% to 2030. By data-center type, colocation facilities led with 54.3% revenue share in 2024, while hyperscale providers are projected to expand at a 12.1% CAGR through 2030."
*   **Date:** June 20, 2025
*   **Source:** Saudi Arabia Data Center Server Market Size & Trends Analysis 2025 – 2030, Vertex AI Search Grounding API Redirect
*   **Impact:** Medium. While this snippet provides 2024 market context, it reinforces the strong underlying demand for AI/ML workloads and the expansion of hyperscale providers in the region. This trend supports the rationale behind the large GPU deployments mentioned in other snippets and suggests a sustained growth environment for NVIDIA's data center segment.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known trend, but specific regional market share and growth drivers might be less emphasized in broader consensus. The detail provides strong corroboration for the specific deals.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradictions:** There are no direct contradictions among the findings. The Qualcomm MoU with HUMAIN is a potential future competitive dynamic but does not contradict the immediate NVIDIA shipment.
*   **Gaps:** The information is specific to Saudi Arabia. While highly material, it doesn't provide a global picture of AI data center approvals. The COD for the HUMAIN 500 MW data center is not explicitly stated, only the May 2025 GPU shipment. More specific details on the timeline for the USD 20 billion Supermicro/DataVolt collaboration's impact on NVIDIA's order book would be beneficial.
