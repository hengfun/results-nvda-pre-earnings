## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the available information regarding air freight logs for AI server kits into mainland China, focusing on material, non-consensus data relevant to NVIDIA's upcoming earnings.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Recent freight data from Taiwan indicates a robust demand for AI servers, with EVA Air projecting a more than 20% increase in Taiwan's AI server shipments for the second half of 2025. However, this surge appears to be primarily directed towards the U.S. and other regions, rather than mainland China. In fact, EVA Air reported a nearly 3% decline in shipments to China between May and July 2025. This suggests a potential shift in supply chain dynamics, where Taiwanese AI server production, which often includes NVIDIA components, is increasingly serving non-Chinese markets.

Taiwanese exports in July 2025 saw an all-time high, largely driven by AI technologies and high-end servers, with the U.S. surpassing China as Taiwan's largest export destination for the second consecutive month. This further supports the notion that the primary beneficiaries of Taiwan's AI server export boom are not in mainland China.

A significant, albeit not entirely non-consensus, development is the ongoing U.S. government's practice of secretly embedding tracking devices in targeted shipments of advanced AI chips, including those from NVIDIA and AMD, suspected of illegal diversion to China. This tactic, reported in mid-August 2025, highlights the stringent export controls in place and suggests a constrained, rather than surging, legitimate supply of high-end AI server kits into mainland China. While NVIDIA denies installing such trackers, the awareness of these measures within the supply chain could impact shipping routes and methods for any chips destined for China.

Hong Kong's general air cargo statistics for June 2025 showed a slight year-on-year decrease in cargo traffic, with declines in traffic to/from North America, partially offset by growth to/from Europe and the Middle East. The Baltic Air Freight Index also indicated little change in global air freight rates in July, with Hong Kong outbound rates remaining largely stable. These general cargo trends do not suggest a specific "airlift spike" for AI server kits into mainland China from Hong Kong.

In summary, while there is strong global demand for AI servers, the available data points to a redirection of Taiwan's AI server exports away from mainland China, coupled with intensified U.S. efforts to restrict the flow of advanced AI chips to China. There is no clear indication of an "airlift spike" of AI server kits into mainland China since mid-August from the reviewed freight logs.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "EVA Air President Clay Sun (孫嘉明) said the company's cargo revenue will keep growing in the second half of this year, mainly driven by a more than 20% increase in Taiwan's AI server shipments. ... The airline's cargo business, which primarily handles goods for the ICT sector, has seen a mixed performance from May to July, per CNA. Shipments to China declined by nearly 3% during that period, while exports to Southeast Asia increased. Sun said that some clients have requested charter flights to secure transportation for large export volumes."
    *   **Date:** August 21, 2025
    *   **Source:** Taiwan News, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHGRKz2BQ806PFqtLDVQ7vDyFd4Llm0oNi546gyB2lPMiLYRRrBp56eY1MKlPuWlnFsShLVhCbFRWJ3ZgwxI4rv-KgVE4QyJBORBtURYcziAS-mWbFT5vC2L2if7uv0bSvP91Fu
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates strong overall AI server demand from Taiwan, which is positive for NVIDIA's component sales. However, the decline in shipments to China from May to July suggests that this demand is not translating into increased airlifts *into* mainland China, which is directly contrary to the user's query about a spike. The mention of charter flights for large export volumes is interesting but not specified for China.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The general increase in AI server shipments from Taiwan is likely known, but the specific decline in shipments to China from May-July might be less widely highlighted.

*   **Snippet:** "Taiwanese exports last month surged to an all-time high, buoyed by robust global demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, early stocking of next-generation mobile devices and accelerated shipments ahead of potential US tariff changes, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. ... The US overtook China as Taiwan's largest export destination last month for a second straight month, as American tech giants — Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Google parent ..."
    *   **Date:** July 09, 2025 (reporting on "last month," i.e., June 2025 data)
    *   **Source:** Taipei Times, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGJdkYCL5FJZR8VLmaWO5bwPClQ6qGw_taTsDZji1fWIiGpL9Q6rYeKOvlYBf_ZYE8vgpMTr4aZ2IDrBfsbv1rLS0cp4gUAVRU5EWwzgXHL-N_v8KOKtEIPB59qyGOUkVax0Kt8nHUBfUxWW7J1UzBQgGPcZjBORH51W9crCQ==
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This confirms strong AI-related export demand from Taiwan but explicitly states the US is the primary destination, not China. This contradicts the idea of an airlift spike *into* mainland China.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The overall strength of Taiwanese exports driven by AI is likely known, but the specific shift in top export destination from China to the US for two consecutive months might be less emphasized in broader market commentary.

*   **Snippet:** "U.S. authorities have secretly embedded location tracking devices in some targeted shipments of advanced chips they see as being at risk of illegal diversion to China, Reuters reported, citing people with knowledge of the law enforcement tactic. ... An affidavit submitted with a U.S. Department of Justice complaint related to the arrests of two Chinese nationals charged with illegally shipping AI chips to China earlier this month noted how one co-conspirator instructed another to check for trackers on Quanta H200 servers, which consist of Nvidia chips, the report added."
    *   **Date:** August 13, 2025
    *   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHbWH2IPWCmLYoZA5pBGyNBX5T1hfitjfjohQtUSeji8UaRiIEaa-_2ZBh689pPzFgclG2YiQH7tpeJOEvdeg2wysqkYG1dSrFrvUBZaorTL8bUXuWK2VJufagZoeTPqHZ5o_ZCXKlNX7svR9CDecQDCyyPTIauwwClE5bOPIyNiawEjasV0-8Rdl9ijjbmcJx01Wq_MnkQIg60sp3Eyc9GkMijAfRu
    *   **Impact:** High. This is highly material as it directly impacts the flow of NVIDIA's advanced AI chips to China. The active tracking and arrests indicate a strong enforcement of export controls, making a legitimate "airlift spike" of high-end AI server kits into mainland China highly unlikely. This suggests a constrained market for NVIDIA's advanced chips in China.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While Reuters reported this, the specific details about Quanta H200 servers with Nvidia chips and the explicit instruction to check for trackers are quite specific and might be considered non-consensus or at least a deeper dive into a known issue. NVIDIA's denial of installing trackers is also noted.

*   **Snippet:** "Airfreight rates out of Taiwan and South Asia are increasing, driven primarily by shipments of AI servers destined for major U.S. tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Meta. Some manufacturers have shifted production from China back to Taiwan to avoid the tariffs, which has contributed to the spike."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This reinforces the trend of AI server shipments from Taiwan primarily going to the U.S. and highlights a "spike" in airfreight rates *out of Taiwan* due to this demand, but not specifically *into* mainland China. It also mentions a shift of production from China back to Taiwan, further indicating a complex and shifting supply chain dynamic.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This information from a freight forwarder publication is likely more niche than mainstream financial news and provides specific color on the drivers of airfreight demand out of Taiwan.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Direct Evidence of Airlift Spikes into Mainland China:** The primary objective of finding "airlift spikes for AI server kits into mainland China since mid-Aug" was not directly met. The evidence points to strong AI server demand globally and from Taiwan, but with a clear redirection away from mainland China and increased scrutiny on shipments to China.
*   **Granular Mid-August Data:** While some articles are from mid-August, they discuss broader trends or the tracking of chips, not specific freight log data showing a spike *into* mainland China during that precise period.
*   **Non-Consensus on China Demand:** The overall picture suggests that the market for advanced AI server kits in mainland China is constrained by export controls, making a "spike" in legitimate airlifts unlikely. Any increase would likely be through illicit channels, which are being actively monitored.
