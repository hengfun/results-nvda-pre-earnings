## Analysis

Despite extensive searches for analyses of patent filings related to novel AI accelerator architectures within the last three months (May 27, 2025 - August 27, 2025) that could materially impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q2 FY2026 earnings or forward-looking guidance, no specific, non-consensus information meeting these criteria was found.

The executed web searches, including queries targeting NVIDIA's new AI chip architecture IP, next-gen AI accelerator innovation, competitor breakthroughs, and supply chain rumors related to AI architecture, did not yield publicly available, detailed analyses of recent patent filings. Such in-depth and timely patent analysis, particularly with a direct link to immediate earnings impact, is often proprietary or published by specialized research firms behind paywalls, and thus not accessible through general web searches within the specified timeframe.

Therefore, based on the available public information and the search parameters, there are no specific findings to report regarding novel AI accelerator patent filings impacting NVIDIA's upcoming earnings.
