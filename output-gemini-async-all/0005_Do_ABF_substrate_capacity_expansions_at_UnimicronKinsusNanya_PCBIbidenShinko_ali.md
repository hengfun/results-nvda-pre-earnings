## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the focus for Q2 FY2026 earnings (quarter ending July 2025) is on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding ABF substrate capacity expansions from key suppliers (Unimicron, Kinsus, Nanya PCB, Ibiden, Shinko) and their alignment with NVIDIA's Q3–Q4 volume plans. The current date is August 27, 2025, and NVIDIA reports earnings today. Information published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025) has been prioritized.

The research indicates a tight but expanding ABF substrate market, with key suppliers aggressively increasing capacity, much of which is pre-allocated to major AI GPU manufacturers like NVIDIA. While overall capacity is growing, the demand for high-end, large-body, high-layer-count substrates required for NVIDIA's Blackwell (B100/B200/B300) GPUs is exceptionally strong and is consuming a disproportionate share of new capacity. Potential risks include technical challenges like warpage in advanced packaging and the critical importance of successful ramp-ups of new facilities. Recent reports suggest a significant increase in NVIDIA's GPU supply, driven by the B200/B300 ramp, implying that ABF substrate supply is largely keeping pace with NVIDIA's aggressive targets.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Kinsus and Nanya PCB Specifics:** While Kinsus and Nanya PCB are mentioned as "Taiwan's ABF substrate leaders" experiencing double-digit growth due to AI demand, specific capacity expansion details or direct allocation to NVIDIA for Q3-Q4 2025 are less explicit compared to Unimicron and Ibiden in the recent data. One older snippet (May 29, 2025) noted Nanya PCB's Q2 earnings might miss forecasts due to currency and political factors, which could indicate some operational headwinds for a key supplier, though not directly tied to NVIDIA's ABF supply.
*   **Shinko Electric:** Specific Q3-Q4 2025 capacity expansion and NVIDIA alignment for Shinko Electric were not found in the recent search results, though one snippet mentions a Yamanashi Expansion starting Q1 2026 with an undisclosed customer.
*   **Yield Rates and Quality:** While warpage risk is mentioned for NVIDIA's CoWoP architecture, more granular details on actual yield rates for advanced ABF substrates from specific suppliers for NVIDIA's Blackwell products would provide a clearer picture of potential bottlenecks or efficiencies. The 85% yield for GB200 server racks is positive but is for the rack assembly, not specifically the ABF substrate manufacturing yield.
*   **Pricing Power:** The statement that "Technology leaders like Ibiden and Unimicron will command premium pricing" implies potential cost pressure for NVIDIA, but the extent of this impact on NVIDIA's gross margins for Q3-Q4 2025 is not quantified.

**Overall Assessment:**

The ABF substrate supply chain appears to be in a dynamic state of aggressive expansion to meet unprecedented AI demand. Key suppliers like Unimicron and Ibiden are bringing significant new capacity online in 2025, much of which is directly or indirectly tied to NVIDIA's Blackwell platform. While demand continues to outpace supply for the most advanced substrates, recent data suggests NVIDIA's GPU supply is increasing significantly, indicating that the ABF substrate supply is largely aligning with NVIDIA's ambitious volume plans for Q3-Q4 2025. However, the market remains tight, with potential risks from technical challenges and the critical importance of successful new plant ramps. The specific details on Unimicron's and Ibiden's Q4 2025 capacity and the high consumption rate of B200 substrates are material, non-consensus insights that could influence market perception of NVIDIA's ability to execute on its Blackwell ramp.
