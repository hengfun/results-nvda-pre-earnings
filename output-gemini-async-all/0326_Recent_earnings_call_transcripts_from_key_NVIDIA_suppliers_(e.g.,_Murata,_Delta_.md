## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the focus for Q2 FY2026 (quarter ending July 2025) is on identifying material, non-consensus information from key suppliers that could impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance, particularly concerning the Blackwell architecture. Research was filtered for web content published within the last three months.

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Murata Manufacturing's Cautious Outlook on "Major Platform Changes" Impacting Market Share**
    *   **Snippet:** "Yes, we do expect some increase in Q2 and Q3 in line with seasonal trends. However, as I mentioned earlier, since there are no major platform changes taking place this year, our market share hasn't risen significantly. So, while we do expect the usual seasonal uplift, we don't see it reaching the level we had initially hoped for. That's the situation we're seeing in 2025."
    *   **Date:** July 30, 2025 (Earnings Call), published July 30, 2025 / August 4, 2025.
    *   **Source:** Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (MRAAY) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha.
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High.
        *   **Reasoning:** Murata is a critical supplier of passive components (e.g., MLCCs, inductors) essential for high-performance computing, including NVIDIA's GPUs. Murata's fiscal year 2025 runs from April 2025 to March 2026. NVIDIA announced Blackwell in March 2024, with a significant ramp expected in 2025. Murata's statement that "no major platform changes" are driving a *significant* market share increase *this year* (their FY2025) could imply a slower-than-expected ramp for Blackwell-related component demand from Murata's perspective. Alternatively, it might suggest that Murata's share of components within the Blackwell platform is not as high as their share in previous generations, or that the "major platform change" impact is yet to materialize for them. This could temper expectations for NVIDIA's Blackwell revenue ramp in the near term.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market generally anticipates a robust and rapid ramp for NVIDIA's Blackwell platform. This statement, if interpreted as related to Blackwell, presents a potential non-consensus view on the pace of its initial impact on a key supplier's market share.

2.  **Delta Electronics Reports Robust AI & Data Center Growth, Showcases Next-Gen NVIDIA Solutions**
    *   **Snippet 1:** "AI & Data Center Strength: Robust growth was driven by data center-related and power electronics businesses, benefiting from global AI deployment."
    *   **Snippet 2:** "Delta Unveils Next-generation Power and Cooling Solutions for AI Data Centers at NVIDIA GTC 2025"
    *   **Date:** July 31, 2025 (Q2 2025 Earnings Call), published July 31, 2025 (Snippet 1). August 8, 2025 (News release mentioning GTC 2025 event), published August 8, 2025 (Snippet 2).
    *   **Source:**
        *   Snippet 1: Delta Electronics Inc Investor Relations - Alpha Spread.
        *   Snippet 2: News Center - Delta Electronics.
    *   **Impact:** High.
        *   **Reasoning:** Delta Electronics is a crucial supplier of power and thermal management solutions for data centers, including those housing NVIDIA's AI accelerators. The explicit mention of "next-generation Power and Cooling Solutions for AI Data Centers at NVIDIA GTC 2025" directly links Delta's recent product development and market focus to NVIDIA's latest platforms, strongly implying Blackwell. The reported "robust growth" in data center-related and power electronics businesses, driven by "global AI deployment," indicates strong and increasing demand for components integral to NVIDIA's AI systems. This provides a positive demand signal from a critical infrastructure supplier.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known, but the specific linkage to "next-generation" and "NVIDIA GTC 2025" provides more granular detail than general "AI boom" narratives. The strength of this demand from a critical infrastructure supplier might be underappreciated in the context of specific platform ramps.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** Murata's comment regarding "no major platform changes" driving significant market share increases *this year* (their FY2025, ending March 2026) could be seen as contradictory to the broad market expectation of a rapid Blackwell ramp in calendar year 2025. This discrepancy might stem from Murata's specific product exposure to Blackwell, their market share within the new platform, or a differing definition of what constitutes a "major platform change" for their business.
*   **Gaps:** Neither Murata nor Delta Electronics explicitly named "Blackwell" in their public statements, likely due to non-disclosure agreements. The analysis relies on interpreting "next-generation AI," "AI data centers," and "NVIDIA GTC" references as pertaining to Blackwell or future NVIDIA platforms. Additionally, Murata's statement about market share lacks specific quantitative details, making it challenging to precisely gauge the magnitude of any potential slowdown from their perspective.
