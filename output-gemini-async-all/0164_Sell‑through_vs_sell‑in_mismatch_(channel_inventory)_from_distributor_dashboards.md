## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings (quarter ending July 2025) after market close today, August 27, 2025, a review of recent market intelligence reveals several material, non-consensus insights regarding channel inventory and sell-through dynamics. While overall demand for NVIDIA's AI accelerators remains exceptionally strong, specific inventory situations, particularly concerning China-bound chips and the ramp-up of new architectures, could influence the upcoming report and forward-looking guidance.

**Key Findings:**

**1. Resumption of H20 Chip Sales to China and Potential Inventory Monetization**
*   **Snippet:** "In mid-July, Nvidia announced that the U.S. government would grant export licenses for the H20 (and equivalent AMD) chips to China. Huang went on Chinese TV and said licenses are assured and that Nvidia “hopes to start deliveries soon”. In practice, this means NVDA can finally ship the backlog of Chinese orders. Analysts immediately saw this as a game-changer. Melius Research (via the news) called Nvidia's “getting back in China after a mid-Apr ban” a “huge tailwind”. Another firm estimated that roughly $10 billion of H20-related inventory could be monetized once shipments resume, potentially adding $0.30 to FY2026 EPS. In short, the worst of China's headwind may have passed. For Q2, some of those unshipped H20 GPUs may finally contribute to revenue, which could lift results well above the conservative $45 billion guidance."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** Nvidia's $4 Trillion Test Comes With Q2 Earnings (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha, seekingalpha.com
*   **Impact:** High. NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 results included a $4.5 billion charge for excess H20 inventory due to prior export restrictions, and Q2 FY2026 guidance already factored in an estimated $8 billion reduction from the halted China business. The mid-July granting of export licenses for H20 chips to China, allowing the shipment of a potential $10 billion backlog, presents a significant upside. Any actual revenue recognized from these shipments in Q2 FY2026 would likely lead to a beat on the company's conservative guidance, directly impacting revenue and potentially improving gross margins.
*   **Consensus Check:** While the resumption of China sales is known, the full extent to which this specific inventory monetization could impact Q2 FY2026 results, given the pre-existing conservative guidance, might be underappreciated by the broader market, which may be more focused on future guidance.

**2. Blackwell GPU Supply Constraints Limiting Near-Term Upside**
*   **Snippet:** "Limited Blackwell GPU supply (few thousand units/quarter) raises doubts about scaling to meet hyperscaler needs." "The production ramp-up for its new Blackwell processors has been particularly challenging. Investors will scrutinize management's commentary on the capacity of its supply chain to meet this sustained demand for its high-performance processors."

*   **Impact:** Medium to High. This indicates that despite immense demand for NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell architecture, supply is currently constrained. While strong demand implies robust sell-through, the limited production capacity ("few thousand units/quarter") suggests NVIDIA may not be able to fully capitalize on this demand in the immediate term. This could cap revenue upside for Q2 FY2026 and potentially impact the Q3 FY2026 guidance, pushing revenue recognition for these high-value products into later quarters.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general narrative of high demand for Blackwell is widely known. However, the specific details regarding the "limited" supply and "challenging" ramp-up, potentially restricting immediate revenue realization, could be a more non-consensus point that impacts near-term expectations.

**3. Mixed Gaming GPU Inventory Dynamics**
*   **Snippet 1:** "RTX Blackwell cards now that they have been released... and immediately disappeared from stock. Though surely restocks will be coming along soon for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs."
*   **Snippet 2:** "RTX 40 series is out of production. there's no more of these chips being made which means the inventory. on store shelves was likely produced back at the end of 2024. or the very beginning of 2025. so even though some prices did drop from last month to this month they were already grossly overpriced."

*   **Impact:** Medium. For NVIDIA's newest gaming GPUs (RTX 50 series, referred to as "RTX Blackwell cards" in one snippet), the immediate disappearance from stock indicates strong sell-through and healthy demand. Conversely, older RTX 40 series GPUs, which are out of production, are being cleared from inventory, with some prices dropping from previous "grossly overpriced" levels. This suggests a healthy transition to new products but could imply some margin pressure or lower average selling prices for the older generation in the gaming segment for Q2 FY2026.
*   **Consensus Check:** The rapid sell-out of new, high-demand GPUs is generally expected. However, the specific commentary on older generations being "grossly overpriced" and now seeing price drops offers a more granular, potentially non-consensus view of the specific inventory clearing dynamics within the gaming channel that could affect segment profitability.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** Some older reports (from August 2024, referring to Q2 FY2025) mentioned "healthy channel inventory" for gaming. However, more recent reports for Q2 FY2026 suggest a more nuanced picture with new products selling out and older products being cleared, indicating a dynamic rather than uniformly "healthy" situation across all gaming GPU generations.
*   **Gap:** While there is significant discussion around the H20 inventory and Blackwell supply, direct, comprehensive "distributor dashboard" data or explicit "sell-through vs. sell-in mismatch" figures for the entire Q2 FY2026 across all product lines (especially for the critical data center segment beyond general supply constraints) are not publicly available in the search results. The information is largely inferred from company statements, analyst reports, and market observations.
