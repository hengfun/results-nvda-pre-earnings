## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025. While consensus estimates point to strong performance driven by AI demand, several non-consensus data points and potential headwinds could materially impact the report or forward-looking guidance. Key areas of focus include the nuanced impact of China's chip regulations, potential supply constraints for next-generation chips, and increasing competition from rivals like AMD.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The market widely anticipates another robust quarter for NVIDIA, with consensus estimates for Q2 FY2026 revenue around $46.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.01. The data center segment is expected to remain the primary growth driver, fueled by insatiable demand for AI infrastructure. However, beneath this optimistic surface, several factors present potential non-consensus risks or opportunities.

A significant development is the recent reversal of the US ban on NVIDIA chip sales to China, now replaced by a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the US government. While this allows NVIDIA to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, potentially boosting revenue, the financial impact is complex. Analysts are divided on whether NVIDIA's Q3 guidance will fully incorporate direct revenue from China sales, and the 15% fee will naturally impact margins. This situation introduces a degree of uncertainty that may not be fully priced into current expectations.

Furthermore, while the demand for NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell and GB200 chips is exceptionally strong, with 2025 production reportedly sold out, there are emerging concerns about the ramp-up of the Blackwell Ultra. Reports suggest potential supply chain bottlenecks and limited production of only a few thousand units per quarter for the Blackwell Ultra, which could delay revenue recognition and introduce short-term volatility. This specific constraint on the most advanced chips could temper the "bull case" expectations for the pace of the Blackwell transition.

Competition in the AI chip market is also intensifying. AMD's Instinct MI350 series is noted for being 30% cheaper than NVIDIA's B200 while offering more memory, and AMD's strong Q3 guidance suggests growing interest in GPU alternatives among hyperscalers. This aggressive pricing and performance from a key competitor could signal future pricing pressure or a slight erosion of NVIDIA's dominant market share, a factor that might be overlooked amidst NVIDIA's overall leadership.

Finally, while NVIDIA's partners generally reflect strong demand, a closer look reveals some potential nuances. CoreWeave, a significant NVIDIA partner, reported a substantial $30.1 billion backlog but only booked $1.4 billion in *new* contracts this quarter, a notable decrease from previous periods. Similarly, Navitas Semiconductor, a partner for NVIDIA's new 800-volt architecture, is projecting only modest Q2 revenue growth. These details could indicate a moderation in the pace of new bookings or a slower-than-expected impact of new architectures on the supply chain, which might not align with the broader narrative of unbridled AI growth.

**Structured Findings:**

---

- **Snippet:** "Originally banned in April, the sale of Nvidia chips to China was allowed again in July, but the company must now pay a 15% fee on sales in the country. Analysts and investors are closely watching the impact of this move on Nvidia's earnings and AI-driven growth."

- **Impact:** High. The reversal of the China ban is positive, but the 15% fee introduces a new cost structure. The uncertainty around how Q3 guidance will reflect China revenue is material.
- **Consensus Check:** The initial ban and its $8 billion impact were widely known. The *reversal* and the *15% revenue-sharing agreement* are more recent and their full financial implications, especially for forward guidance, might not be entirely priced in or understood by all investors.

- **Impact:** Medium. While Blackwell demand is high, specific supply constraints on the Ultra version could temper expectations for its immediate revenue contribution and the pace of hyperscaler adoption.
- **Consensus Check:** General excitement around Blackwell is high. Specific details about *limited supply* for the Blackwell Ultra and the potential for delayed revenue recognition could be overlooked by some investors.

- **Snippet:** "Even with the recent price hike, AMD's newest GPU, the Instinct MI350 series, remains 30% cheaper than its chip-to-chip competitor. Featuring 288 GB of memory compared to the B200's 192 GBs, the company is determined to gain market share by offering an unbeatable price-to-performance ratio. AMD's strong guidance for Q3, at $8.7 billion (28% YoY growth), suggests that Dr. Su's strategy is in motion and there is growing interest and customer demand for GPU optionality — a point we will revisit later on in the post."

- **Impact:** Medium. AMD's aggressive pricing and competitive performance for its MI350 series, coupled with strong guidance, could signal increasing competition and potential future pricing pressure for NVIDIA, or a shift in hyperscaler purchasing patterns.
- **Consensus Check:** NVIDIA's dominance is well-known. The specific details of AMD's competitive offering (price/performance) and its strong guidance, indicating "growing interest and customer demand for GPU optionality," might be underappreciated by some investors focused solely on NVIDIA's market leadership.

- **Snippet:** "CoreWeave has a $30.1 billion backlog. The company fills the substantial gap that exists between demand for AI computing power and current supply. It's what has led CoreWeave's top line to explode, up more than 200% year over year as of its second-quarter report. The jump from under $400 million in Q2 2024 to more than $1.21 billion in Q2 2025 is incredible, but can it continue? ... CoreWeave only booked $1.4 billion in new contracts this quarter — not as much as might have been expected."

- **Impact:** Medium. While the backlog is strong, the slowdown in *new* contract bookings for a key NVIDIA partner could indicate a moderation in the pace of new AI infrastructure commitments, potentially impacting NVIDIA's future order book.
- **Consensus Check:** CoreWeave's overall growth and large backlog are likely known. The specific detail about the *rate* of new contract bookings slowing down might be overlooked and could be seen as a subtle indicator of future demand trends.

- **Snippet:** "Navitas Semiconductor will benefit significantly from this Nvidia partnership. ... Management has been aware of the Nvidia partnership for longer than the market, and it is projecting only modest revenue growth in Q2."
- **Date:** July 14, 2025
- **Source:** Is This Critical Nvidia AI Partner Set to Skyrocket in the Second Half of 2025? - Nasdaq, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG8pd0NtTKAnakv09Oquiu-608nlBYhhexT1bmsjAP8sO2knrFuDDJLN5Nb_edP7N2XPfXiKo4RghPOoWnQwxEgeKKojGNV0b-WqUJTe14M6AKAc-khOXgynSRgB4ZhoXWpfI2r_Egs1ISonAcLXGeyJ7UeGtDg4MHHqdGN2yb7Ssf6OdmZFis9GuKtTxdEFxiap1dP
- **Impact:** Low. While Navitas is a smaller partner, its modest Q2 revenue growth projection despite the NVIDIA partnership could suggest that the revenue impact from NVIDIA's new architectures on its supply chain partners might be slower or less significant than some might anticipate.
- **Consensus Check:** The partnership itself might be known. However, the *modest* revenue growth projection from the partner, indicating a slower ramp-up of benefits, could be a non-consensus detail.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **China Revenue Impact:** There's a gap in clarity regarding how NVIDIA's Q3 guidance will account for the resumed China sales and the 15% revenue-sharing fee. While the ability to sell to China again is positive, the net financial impact on future guidance remains a key unknown that could lead to varied interpretations.
*   **Blackwell Ultra Ramp-up Pace:** A contradiction exists between the general bullish sentiment and "sold out" status of Blackwell chips and the specific concerns about "limited supply" and "bottlenecks" for the Blackwell Ultra. The actual pace and scale of the Blackwell Ultra ramp-up will be a critical factor in validating future growth expectations.
*   **Overall Growth Moderation vs. AI Boom:** While NVIDIA's growth is still strong, several sources note a moderation from the explosive rates seen during the initial AI boom. The market's reaction to this "stabilized" but still high growth rate, especially in the context of increasing competition, will be closely watched.
