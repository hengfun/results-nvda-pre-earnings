## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the focus for Q2 FY2026 (quarter ending July 2025) and forward-looking guidance is on material, non-consensus information regarding supplier prepayment disclosures and capacity reservations from key partners like TSMC, ASE, and Amkor. While explicit "prepayment disclosures" are rarely public, recent supply chain reports and partner outlooks offer strong indications of NVIDIA's capacity commitments and potential impacts on upcoming earnings.

The research, filtered for content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025 - August 27, 2025), reveals several key developments regarding NVIDIA's supply chain and its implications for Q3 FY2026 and beyond.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's aggressive push into next-generation AI chips like Blackwell and Rubin is clearly reflected in its ongoing capacity reservations with major suppliers. Recent reports indicate a multi-faceted sourcing strategy involving TSMC for advanced wafer production, and both Amkor and ASE for crucial advanced packaging. This broad engagement suggests NVIDIA is working to diversify and secure its supply chain to meet anticipated robust demand for its future products.

A significant positive signal comes from Amkor's optimistic Q3 2025 revenue outlook, which, given its role as a key packaging partner for NVIDIA, indirectly points to strong demand for NVIDIA's components. This suggests that packaging bottlenecks, a historical concern, might be easing or are being effectively managed. Furthermore, broader reports indicate that NVIDIA has been successful in alleviating High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) shortages through close collaboration with its suppliers, which is critical for the production ramp of its high-performance GPUs.

However, a recent and potentially material negative development is the directive from NVIDIA to its suppliers, including Amkor, to pause production of H20 AI chips specifically tailored for the Chinese market. This move, driven by geopolitical tensions and Chinese government directives, could impact NVIDIA's revenue from the China region in Q3 and subsequent quarters, potentially offsetting some of the gains from other segments. The extent of this impact on overall guidance will be a key point of interest in the upcoming earnings call.

Overall, while NVIDIA appears to be securing substantial capacity for its cutting-edge AI chips, the geopolitical headwinds in China present a notable risk that could temper an otherwise strong demand environment.

### Structured Findings:

**1. NVIDIA's Multi-faceted Capacity Reservations for Next-Gen AI Chips**

*   **Snippet:** "Of this substantial allocation, 515,000 wafers will come from TSMC, with 510,000 specifically designated for CoWoS-L technology. This capacity will be primarily utilised for its next-generation Rubin AI chips, Vera CPUs, GB100, and automotive chips. Nvidia has also enlisted non-TSMC suppliers, including Amkor and ASE, for the remaining 80,000 wafers, demonstrating a multi-faceted sourcing strategy to support its diverse product lines. Total shipments of Nvidia chips could reach 5.4 million units in 2026, including 2.4 million Rubin-based chips."
*   **Date:** August 4, 2025
*   **Source:** Advanced Packaging Demand Soars: Nvidia Secures 60% of CoWoS Capacity, Astute Electronics
*   **Impact:** High. This provides specific, forward-looking data on NVIDIA's capacity commitments across multiple key suppliers (TSMC, Amkor, ASE) for its next-generation products (Rubin, GB100). The detailed wafer allocation and 2026 shipment projections offer concrete evidence of anticipated demand and supply chain readiness, directly impacting future revenue guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** While NVIDIA's general dominance and reliance on TSMC are known, the specific breakdown of wafer allocations across TSMC, Amkor, and ASE for *next-gen* chips like Rubin and GB100, along with the 2026 shipment forecast, is likely non-consensus and provides granular insight into NVIDIA's long-term supply strategy.

**2. Amkor's Optimistic Q3 2025 Outlook**

*   **Snippet:** "Looking ahead to Q3 2025, Amkor provided an optimistic outlook with revenue expected to reach between $1.875 billion and $1.975 billion, representing a substantial 27% sequential increase at the midpoint. The company also projects improved profitability, with gross margin expected to range from 13.0% to 14.5%, net income between $85 million and $120 million, and diluted EPS of $0.34 to $0.48. The company maintained its 2025 capital expenditure guidance at $850 million, indicating continued investment in growth initiatives despite recent market challenges."

*   **Source:** Amkor Q2 2025 slides (Investing.com)
*   **Impact:** Medium. Amkor is a significant advanced packaging partner for NVIDIA. Its strong Q3 2025 revenue guidance, with a substantial sequential increase, indirectly suggests robust demand from its key customers, including NVIDIA, for packaging services. This implies that NVIDIA's products are moving through the packaging stage efficiently, supporting strong sales.
*   **Consensus Check:** Amkor's earnings outlook is public information. However, interpreting this specific guidance as a strong positive indicator for NVIDIA's Q3 performance and forward guidance, especially in the context of NVIDIA's reliance on advanced packaging, could be a non-consensus read or provide a more specific linkage than generally acknowledged.

**3. Pause in Amkor Production for NVIDIA's China-Specific H20 AI Chips**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has directed several of its component suppliers, including Samsung Electronics and Amkor Technology, to pause production of its H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips tailored exclusively for the Chinese market, Azernews reports, citing foreign media. This suspension comes shortly after the Chinese government urged domestic technology firms to cease purchasing these customized chips due to alleged security risks."
*   **Date:** August 23, 2025
*   **Source:** Today.Az / AzerNews
*   **Impact:** High. This is a very recent and specific development directly impacting a key supplier (Amkor) and a specific NVIDIA product line (H20 chips for China). A production pause just days before earnings could lead to a downward revision of China-related revenue expectations for Q3 and potentially impact forward guidance for the region.
*   **Consensus Check:** While U.S.-China trade tensions and export controls are widely known, a *recent directive to pause production* of specific chips with specific suppliers like Amkor, just ahead of earnings, is likely non-consensus and represents a material, immediate headwind.

**4. Alleviation of HBM Shortages and Blackwell Production Ramp**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's Data Center segment—a proxy for its AI-driven compute business—reported $30.8 billion in revenue for Q3 FY2025, a 17% sequential jump and a staggering 112% year-over-year increase. ... The catalyst? The Blackwell GPU. ... NVIDIA projecting Q4 FY2025 revenue of $37.5 billion—driven in large part by Blackwell sales. Yet challenges remain. HBM shortages have constrained output, but NVIDIA's close collaboration with suppliers has started to alleviate these bottlenecks."
*   **Date:** June 17, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA's Compute Surge: How Supply Chain Mastery and AI Demand Are Fueling Q3 2025 Growth and Beyond - AInvest
*   **Impact:** High. This snippet highlights strong Q3 FY2025 data center revenue and robust Q4 FY2025 guidance, explicitly attributing it to Blackwell sales. Crucially, it mentions that HBM shortages, a known constraint, are being *alleviated* through "close collaboration with suppliers." This implies successful capacity securing and operational efficiency from NVIDIA's memory and packaging partners, which is a positive signal for meeting demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** HBM shortages have been a widely discussed topic. The *alleviation* of these bottlenecks and the strong revenue projections directly linked to Blackwell's ramp-up, as a result of "close collaboration" with suppliers, could be seen as a more optimistic and potentially non-consensus view on NVIDIA's ability to overcome supply challenges.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** There isn't a direct contradiction among the selected snippets. However, the positive outlook from Amkor (Snippet 3) for Q3 2025 revenue growth needs to be balanced against the negative news of the H20 chip production pause (Snippet 28/34), which also involves Amkor. The overall impact on Amkor's revenue from NVIDIA will depend on the scale of the H20 pause versus other NVIDIA-related business.
*   **Gaps:** The information lacks explicit financial figures for NVIDIA's *prepayments* to these suppliers for Q3 FY2026. While capacity reservations are indicated, the specific accounting treatment (e.g., increased "prepaid expenses" on NVIDIA's balance sheet) is not directly available from these external reports. This is a common challenge when seeking such granular, non-public financial data.
