## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into recent developments, particularly from key hyperscaler Alphabet (GOOGL), reveals both strong tailwinds and potential headwinds that could impact NVIDIA's performance and forward-looking guidance. While consensus largely anticipates robust growth driven by AI demand, specific details from Alphabet's recent earnings and some analyst commentary suggest areas of non-consensus information that warrant close attention.

Alphabet's Q2 2025 earnings, reported on July 23, 2025, highlighted a significant surge in Google Cloud's AI-driven demand. Google Cloud revenue increased by 32% year-over-year to $13.6 billion, with its Gemini AI usage surging 35 times from the previous year. This explosive growth has prompted Alphabet to increase its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, bringing the total to $85 billion, with the additional funds specifically allocated for AI infrastructure. The company also reported a 38% increase in Google Cloud's order backlog, reaching a staggering $106 billion, indicating sustained high demand for its cloud and AI services.

Crucially for NVIDIA, Google's aggressive AI infrastructure build-out includes a substantial commitment to NVIDIA's latest generation GPUs. Google's current AI hardware comprises approximately 1 million custom-designed Ironwood v7 TPUs and 500,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, with an "incoming delivery of 400,000 to 600,000 of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs" planned. This significant order for Blackwell GPUs underscores the continued reliance of major cloud providers on NVIDIA's cutting-edge technology. Alphabet's finance chief also noted a "tight supply environment" for cloud services, which is expected to persist into 2026, suggesting that demand for AI infrastructure, and thus GPUs, continues to outstrip supply.

However, not all signals are unequivocally bullish for NVIDIA. A non-consensus view from Seeking Alpha suggests that while NVIDIA's past performance has been stellar, future returns could be threatened by rising competition and a deceleration in growth momentum. The article highlights that hyperscalers like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are actively pursuing initiatives to reduce their dependence on NVIDIA's GPUs, with Alphabet's TPUs posing a potential long-term threat, particularly in inference workloads. The article also points out that NVIDIA's projected Q2 FY2026 revenue growth of "only" 50% (based on NVIDIA's own forecast) would represent the lowest growth since Q2 2024, indicating a potential cooling of the hyper-growth phase. Furthermore, despite the high demand for NVIDIA's new Blackwell GPUs, supply constraints, "limited to a few thousand units per quarter," raise questions about the company's ability to scale production sufficiently to meet the insatiable appetite of hyperscalers.

    *   **Impact:** High. This is a specific, large, and recent order for NVIDIA's newest, highest-margin products from a major hyperscaler. It directly translates to significant revenue for NVIDIA in the coming quarters and validates the strong demand for Blackwell.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general demand for Blackwell is known, the specific volume of Google's order (400k-600k units) is a highly material detail that might not be fully priced into consensus estimates.

*   **Snippet:** "Alphabet raised its 2025 capital spending forecast by $10 billion to $85 billion, with the additional $10 billion earmarked for AI infrastructure." and "The surge in usage led to a 38 percent increase in Google Cloud's order backlog, reaching $106 billion."

    *   **Impact:** High. The increased capex specifically for AI infrastructure directly benefits NVIDIA. The massive and growing cloud backlog signifies sustained, long-term demand for the underlying compute power, largely provided by NVIDIA's GPUs.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known in terms of Alphabet's overall capex, but the direct implication of the $106 billion backlog for NVIDIA's long-term revenue stream might be underappreciated in short-term earnings models.

*   **Snippet:** "It's a tight supply environment,” Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said during the company's post-earnings conference call, acknowledging the high demand. The revised $85 billion forecast will fuel the development of Google's Gemini family of AI models and expand its data center footprint."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. A "tight supply environment" suggests continued pricing power for NVIDIA and indicates that demand for AI hardware is not abating. This supports a strong outlook for NVIDIA's data center segment.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that AI hardware demand is high, but the explicit statement from a major cloud provider's CFO about a "tight supply environment" continuing into 2026 adds specific color and reinforces the demand-side strength.

*   **Snippet:** "Besides Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft in particular are pushing ahead with ambitious initiatives to reduce their dependence on Nvidia's GPUs. In addition, it is now also obvious that the growth momentum is cooling significantly. Nvidia expects revenue of $45 billion for Q2 2026. In Q2 2025, revenue was $30 billion, which would mean revenue growth of "only" 50%. Even if we add the $8 billion in unrealized revenue due to export controls forecast by Nvidia, growth would be 76%. Still impressive, no question, but that would also be the lowest growth since Q2 2024."

    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct non-consensus argument challenging NVIDIA's sustained hyper-growth and highlighting competitive threats from hyperscalers' in-house chip development (like Google's TPUs). The specific mention of 50% growth being the "lowest since Q2 2024" could temper market expectations if this view gains traction.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While the idea of hyperscaler self-reliance is discussed, this article explicitly frames it as "trouble ahead" and points to a significant deceleration in growth momentum, which goes against the prevailing bullish narrative.

*   **Snippet:** "The Blackwell GPU, Nvidia's next-generation AI processor, is already sampling with partners, but supply constraints—limited to a few thousand units per quarter—highlight the gap between demand and production."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While demand for Blackwell is high, limited supply could cap NVIDIA's revenue growth in the short term, even with strong orders. This could lead to a "beat-and-raise" scenario that is less pronounced than some investors might expect.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. Supply constraints are a recurring theme in the semiconductor industry, but the specific "few thousand units per quarter" for Blackwell is a concrete detail that could be more impactful than generally understood.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Growth Outlook:** There's a clear contradiction between the general market expectation of continued robust growth for NVIDIA (driven by hyperscaler demand and Blackwell) and the Seeking Alpha article's assertion of "cooling growth momentum" and a "lowest growth since Q2 2024" scenario.
*   **Blackwell Impact:** While Google's large Blackwell order is a strong positive, the reported "limited supply" of Blackwell GPUs (a few thousand units per quarter) creates a gap between potential demand and actual fulfillment, which could constrain NVIDIA's immediate revenue upside from its newest architecture.
*   **Hyperscaler Dependence vs. Self-Reliance:** The information highlights both the continued dependence of hyperscalers on NVIDIA's GPUs and their ongoing efforts to develop in-house chips. The extent to which these self-reliance initiatives will impact NVIDIA's long-term market share and revenue growth is a key area of uncertainty.
