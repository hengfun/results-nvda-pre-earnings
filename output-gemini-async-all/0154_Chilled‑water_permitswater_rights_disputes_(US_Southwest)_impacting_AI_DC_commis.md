## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, I have identified several material, non-consensus insights regarding chilled-water permits and water rights disputes in the US Southwest that are likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The rapid expansion of AI data centers, which are critical for NVIDIA's chip demand, is encountering increasing regulatory and environmental hurdles related to water scarcity in key regions where NVIDIA and its partners are establishing operations.

While the general issue of data center water consumption is gaining awareness, the specific, recent, and localized regulatory actions, coupled with NVIDIA's direct manufacturing presence in these water-stressed areas, represent a potentially overlooked risk factor. The interplay between federal efforts to streamline permitting and persistent local resistance creates a complex and potentially volatile operating environment for AI infrastructure development.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1**
- **Snippet:** "Now, with the unanimous passage of a new ordinance by the city council, any large water user that wants to gain access to Tucson's water will have to apply to the city and show its water conservation efforts. The goal, said Mayor Regina Romero, was to protect the city from large water users like data centers as quickly as possible."

- **Impact:** High. This is a very recent and specific regulatory action in Arizona, a state where NVIDIA has manufacturing operations for its Blackwell chips. New data center projects or expansions in the Tucson area, whether by NVIDIA's partners or customers, will face immediate and stringent water conservation requirements, potentially delaying commissioning and increasing operational costs.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general water concerns are known, this specific, newly passed ordinance in a key Southwest city is likely not fully factored into broader market consensus for NVIDIA's near-term operational environment.

**Finding 2**
- **Snippet:** "Based on the findings Toro shared, 1,082 data centers are being planned or built across 10 states that are experiencing some degree of water stress. In states grappling with acute water stress, such as Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Utah, California, and Colorado, 437 data centers are planned or are currently under construction. The amount of water used in data centers depends on the facility type, which generally falls under one of two categories."

- **Impact:** High. This provides a quantitative overview of the significant number of AI data centers being developed in water-stressed regions, which are primary markets for NVIDIA's AI chips and supercomputers. The sheer volume of projects facing water constraints suggests widespread potential for delays, increased costs, and reduced demand for NVIDIA's products if commissioning is hampered.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. The general trend of data center growth in the Southwest is known, but the specific number (437) of data centers planned or under construction in *acutely water-stressed* states, and the direct implication for NVIDIA's addressable market, might be underestimated.

**Finding 3**
- **Snippet:** "NVIDIA is working with its manufacturing partners to design and build factories that, for the first time, will produce NVIDIA AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S.. Together with leading manufacturing partners, the company has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test NVIDIA Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas. NVIDIA Blackwell chips have started production at TSMC's chip plants in Phoenix, Arizona. NVIDIA is building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, with Foxconn in Houston and with Wistron in Dallas. Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months."

- **Impact:** High. This directly links NVIDIA's own manufacturing expansion to Arizona and Texas, two states identified as acutely water-stressed. While the article is from April, the "mass production expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months" means these water issues will directly affect NVIDIA's own operations or its partners' ability to support its supply chain, potentially leading to delays or increased costs for NVIDIA's US production.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA's US manufacturing plans are known, the specific and recent local water regulatory environment in Arizona and Texas, and its potential impact on NVIDIA's *own* ramp-up, may not be fully appreciated by the market.

**Finding 4**
- **Snippet:** "In Arizona, Chandler caps data center water use at 115 gallons per day per 1,000 square feet, and areas like Marana prohibit the use of potable water to these facilities altogether, forcing developers to secure alternate sources. Tucson's draft “Project Blue” AI complex is projected to consume up to 2,000 acre-feet annually, about 6% of Tucson Water's reclaimed resource capacity, with financial surcharges for overuse included in its approval deal. In Utah, a recent state law tightens permitting for large data centers, specifically targeting facilities expected to consume over 100 million gallons annually."

- **Impact:** High. This snippet provides concrete examples of existing and new regulatory hurdles in Arizona and Utah. These specific caps, prohibitions on potable water, and tightened permitting directly increase the complexity, cost, and potential for delays in commissioning AI data centers in these states, thereby impacting demand for NVIDIA's hardware.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific details of these local and state-level regulations are likely not widely known or fully integrated into financial models, representing a non-consensus risk.

**Finding 5**
- **Snippet:** "On July 23, 2025, the White House issued an Executive Order titled “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.” Released alongside “America's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan,” the Order reflects a broader federal goal to reduce permitting delays for large-scale data center projects supporting AI workloads and national infrastructure. The reforms focus on streamlining federal environmental review and permitting processes, thereby aiming to address longstanding regulatory hurdles that have historically contributed to project delays and cost overruns... Nevertheless, most data center projects will continue to require a mix of federal, state, and local permits. The practical impact of these new federal streamlining measures will depend on a range of factors, including project location, ownership structure, environmental conditions, and the extent to which states choose to align their own permitting processes with federal reforms."

- **Impact:** Medium. While the federal executive order aims to expedite permitting, the crucial caveat is that state and local regulations can still significantly extend timelines. This creates a dichotomy where federal intent clashes with local realities, particularly in water-stressed regions. This could lead to continued uncertainty and delays for AI data center commissioning, despite federal efforts.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. The federal initiative might be seen as a positive, but the nuanced reality of persistent state and local control over water rights and permitting, especially in the Southwest, could be overlooked.

**Finding 6**
- **Snippet:** "In 2025, data centers across the state are projected to use 49 billion gallons of water, enough to supply millions of households, primarily for cooling massive banks of servers that power generative AI and cloud computing... The Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC), in a report obtained by the San Antonio Express-News estimated that Texas data centers would use 49 billion gallons of water in 2025, with consumption projected to soar to 399 billion gallons annually by 2030—representing almost 6.6 percent of the state's total water usage."

- **Source:** Texas Data Centers Use 50 Billion Gallons of Water as State Faces Drought - Newsweek, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFF9U-PDcz8fOXOmbsossthqs9ILluJwvyFthywNeysLAkd-tSk1mwHTAebFfdeqFGhSNQ-qCb2n-Ual_PEE_NvEeq2hejvg35NHsKypYP4_stTMy1H4bVnJG_84IXbdCqnFqchxqWyg49KtpKy63Th3oI7joFvbmrgxHcM3ROyaPSGiUpAlvp4sZs=]
- **Impact:** High. This highlights the immense and rapidly growing water consumption by data centers in Texas, another state where NVIDIA is establishing manufacturing. The projection of water usage soaring to 399 billion gallons annually by 2030, representing a significant portion of the state's total water use, indicates a looming crisis that will almost certainly lead to increased regulatory pressure, public opposition, and potential operational constraints for data centers, thereby impacting NVIDIA's customers and its own supply chain.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. While the scale of water use in Texas is becoming more apparent, the projected exponential increase and its potential to trigger more aggressive state or local regulations, despite current lax state laws, might be underestimated.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Federal vs. Local Control:** There's a clear tension between the federal government's push to expedite data center permitting (July 2025 Executive Order) and the increasing local and state-level regulations and resistance to data center water usage (Tucson, Chandler, Marana, Utah, Texas). The practical impact of federal streamlining efforts may be limited by persistent local control over water rights and land use.
*   **NVIDIA's Direct Water Footprint Transparency:** While the articles discuss the water consumption of AI data centers generally, and NVIDIA's manufacturing presence in water-stressed areas, there's a gap in specific, recent public disclosures from NVIDIA itself regarding its direct water usage for its new US manufacturing facilities and how it plans to navigate these local water disputes and regulations.
*   **Alternative Cooling Adoption Rate:** While some tech companies are exploring alternative cooling technologies like liquid cooling, the rate of adoption and its effectiveness in significantly mitigating the overall water footprint of the rapidly expanding AI data center industry remains unclear. There's also a noted trade-off between water efficiency and energy efficiency.

**Overall Analysis:**

The confluence of NVIDIA's strategic decision to onshore AI supercomputer manufacturing in the US Southwest and Texas, coupled with escalating water scarcity and increasingly stringent local regulations in these very regions, presents a material risk to NVIDIA's operations and the broader AI infrastructure build-out. While federal efforts aim to ease permitting, the power of local and state authorities to control water resources means that delays, increased costs, and even project cancellations due to water disputes are a growing possibility. Investors may be underestimating the friction between the immense water demands of AI data centers and the limited, increasingly regulated water supplies in critical development areas. This could lead to slower-than-expected commissioning of AI data centers, impacting demand for NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs and potentially affecting its forward-looking guidance.
