## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the order backlogs for AI servers at Dell, HPE, and Super Micro, focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The demand for AI servers remains exceptionally strong, with both Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) reporting substantial and growing backlogs. Dell, a major NVIDIA partner, saw its AI server order backlog surge to $14.4 billion in Q1 FY2026 (ending April 2025), a significant increase from the previous quarter. This indicates robust demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, which are integral to these servers. However, Dell has cautioned about "nonlinear" demand, citing dependencies on data center construction, power, and cooling infrastructure, which could lead to uneven revenue recognition despite high orders. This suggests that while the pipeline for NVIDIA's chips is full, the actual conversion to revenue for server manufacturers might not be perfectly smooth.

HPE also reported strong momentum in its AI systems segment, with a $3.2 billion backlog as of Q2 FY2025 (ending July 2025) and a pipeline "multiples of its backlog." HPE is actively deploying NVIDIA's new Blackwell series GB200 products, further underscoring the direct link to NVIDIA's performance. However, HPE noted that its server segment margins are being weighed down by the higher mix of AI systems in the near term, with a recovery to healthier margins not expected until Q4 FY2025. This could imply that the current high demand for AI servers, while good for volume, might be coming at a cost to profitability for some server vendors, which could influence future pricing negotiations or the overall health of the ecosystem.

In contrast to Dell and HPE's strong backlog narratives, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) recently reported weaker-than-expected Q4 FY2025 earnings and a downbeat outlook for Q1 FY2026. The company cited intensifying competition, tariffs, and delayed customer purchasing decisions as contributing factors. This suggests that while overall AI server demand is high, the competitive landscape is intensifying, and not all players are benefiting equally. A particularly non-consensus point is the indication that NVIDIA might be shifting some of Super Micro's orders to other companies to stabilize its supply chain. If true, this could be a significant headwind for Super Micro but potentially a neutral or even positive for NVIDIA if the orders are simply reallocated to other partners like Dell and HPE, who have demonstrated strong capacity.

Furthermore, the Chinese market presents a complex dynamic. Following new U.S. export restrictions on NVIDIA's H20 accelerator, there's a reported surge in demand for older A100 and H100 cards in China, with firms stripping and reconfiguring them into custom inference systems. This indicates that while direct sales of the latest NVIDIA chips to China might be impacted, there's still a strong underlying demand for NVIDIA's older-generation GPUs, albeit through potentially less direct channels. This could affect NVIDIA's revenue mix and average selling prices in the region.

Overall, the findings suggest robust underlying demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs through its server partners, particularly Dell and HPE. However, the "nonlinear" nature of demand conversion, margin pressures on server vendors, increased competition impacting Super Micro, and evolving dynamics in the Chinese market represent material, non-consensus factors that could influence NVIDIA's near-term revenue recognition, guidance, and overall market perception.

### Structured Findings

**Finding 1: Dell's Surging AI Server Backlog with "Nonlinear" Demand Warning**
- **Snippet:** "Dell reported that its AI-optimized server orders reached $12.1 billion (approximately 16.6 trillion won) in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year (February to April), marking a rise of about 612% from the previous quarter ($1.7 billion). As a result, the AI server order backlog increased from $4.1 billion (approximately 5.6 trillion won) in the last quarter to $14.4 billion (approximately 19.8 trillion won) in just one quarter." "Dell has confirmed an order backlog of $14.4 billion for AI optimized servers, yet it is tempering investors' expectations for future sales by talking about demand being lumpy and dependencies in the pipeline."

- **Impact:** High. Dell is a major NVIDIA partner. A $14.4 billion AI server backlog indicates extremely strong demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. However, the "nonlinear" demand warning suggests that while orders are high, the actual revenue conversion can be lumpy due to external factors like data center readiness, which could lead to variability in NVIDIA's near-term revenue recognition from this channel.
- **Consensus Check:** The high backlog is likely widely known, but the nuanced warning about "nonlinear" demand and infrastructure dependencies might be overlooked by some, representing a non-consensus detail.

**Finding 2: HPE's Growing AI Systems Backlog with Near-Term Margin Pressure**
- **Snippet:** "On the AI product side, Q2 revenue reached $1.0B, up over 10% sequentially, with $1.1B in new orders and $3.2B backlog." "Key risk is servers: Q2 operating margin was 5.9%, guided mid-to-high single digits in Q3, with recovery to ~10% not expected until Q4 FY25 exit."

- **Impact:** Medium-High. HPE's $3.2 billion AI systems backlog and strong new orders are positive for NVIDIA. However, the margin pressure in HPE's server segment due to AI systems, with a delayed recovery, could indicate that server manufacturers are absorbing higher costs or facing competitive pricing, which might indirectly affect NVIDIA's pricing power or the overall profitability of the AI server ecosystem in the future.
- **Consensus Check:** The backlog growth is likely known, but the specific details about margin pressure and the timeline for recovery are more granular and potentially overlooked.

**Finding 3: Super Micro's Earnings Miss and Increased Competition**
- **Snippet:** "Super Micro Computer's weak earnings and downbeat outlook have shaken the AI server sector, with shares of Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise falling by 3% and 1.5%, respectively. Super Micro missed revenue and profit estimates for Q4 and issued disappointing guidance for the current quarter, forecasting earnings between $0.40 and $0.52 per share." "The primary factors contributing to SMCI's underwhelming performance are the intensifying competition in the high-performance computing sector for AI applications and the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs."

- **Impact:** Medium. While Super Micro is a smaller partner for NVIDIA compared to hyperscalers, its struggles highlight increasing competition and potential margin pressures in the AI server market. This could indicate a more challenging environment for some of NVIDIA's partners, which might indirectly affect NVIDIA's sales or pricing strategies in the long run.
- **Consensus Check:** Super Micro's earnings miss is likely known, but the detailed reasons (intensifying competition, tariffs, delayed decisions) and the potential for NVIDIA to shift orders away from SMCI are less consensus.

**Finding 4: Potential Shift of NVIDIA Orders Away from Super Micro**
- **Snippet:** "As Nvidia pivots to stabilize its supply chain by shifting Supermicro's orders to other companies, Supermicro faces the risk of being increasingly marginalized in the AI server market."
- **Date:** November 15, 2024 (Note: While the article date is older, the information about NVIDIA potentially shifting orders is a forward-looking statement that remains relevant in the context of SMCI's recent struggles and the current date.)
- **Source:** tastylive, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFf1vi2Cf4FZyFpoEKfZ3jVX0KL0AsyZSV_Rb8EgEa02ScvZIxSgDvcdQlEjjawlOPMG76OZ0mVfhrUwOHndo87cLBwKGjyxiufBNi40s7_X1kw-gsEbm8rqVaBI3IFeCX60s571JsyS7ipHHtGYT-1qujkcf3qj4BphyM4jdr1PpNtCFIL1W3q1Qw_BujTLQHpbrPhgg27eZ4xQaEG1z2m4g==
- **Impact:** Medium. If NVIDIA is indeed reallocating Super Micro's orders to other partners, it could be a negative for Super Micro's future revenue and market share. For NVIDIA, this could be a neutral to slightly positive development if it leads to a more stable and diversified supply chain, but it also highlights potential challenges with certain partners.
- **Consensus Check:** This information is likely non-consensus and could be a significant factor for Super Micro's outlook, and indirectly, NVIDIA's partner strategy.

**Finding 5: Surging Demand for Older NVIDIA GPUs in China Amidst H20 Restrictions**
- **Snippet:** "China's AI industry is quietly turning to refurbished and second-hand Nvidia GPUs after fresh curbs on the company's H20 accelerator left customers scrambling for alternatives... this has led to surging demand for older A100 and H100 cards as firms strip down and reconfigure them into “low-cost, high-performance” custom inference systems."
- **Date:** August 27, 2025
- **Source:** Tom's Hardware, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFpL0xDedHP__4gyFJ7q_W8veL0vI9AZZpIXirJZPirRI89KHpxoUDF608Z7ulCjS2c_S0Tjlqwv3QNW6ABFYOqFRqbaYrUnDIvPAzuVJ85axTCI1l5d6WVhBBwLVhVrITJf7SYv-5aYDusrS6urERsHQ-UQOiz5VbG_IERLGDESPZWdbL7v2efjlxshQ==
- **Impact:** Medium. This indicates a complex and evolving market in China. While direct sales of the latest chips might be hampered, the continued strong demand for older NVIDIA GPUs, even through unconventional channels, suggests persistent underlying demand for NVIDIA's technology. This could impact NVIDIA's revenue mix and average selling prices from the Chinese market, potentially leading to lower-margin sales or a shift in product demand.
- **Consensus Check:** The specific details about the surge in demand for refurbished A100/H100s due to H20 restrictions are likely non-consensus and provide a more granular view of the Chinese market.
