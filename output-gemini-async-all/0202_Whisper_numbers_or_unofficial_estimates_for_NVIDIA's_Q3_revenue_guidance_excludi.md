## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and Q3 FY2026 forward-looking guidance, with a focus on whisper numbers and unofficial estimates for Q3 revenue guidance excluding China.

***

### Human-Readable Analysis

NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, with market attention heavily focused on the company's Q3 FY2026 revenue guidance. A key non-consensus element emerging from recent analyst reports is the strong possibility that NVIDIA's official Q3 guidance may *exclude* direct revenue from the China market. This potential exclusion, primarily highlighted by KeyBanc Capital Markets, is attributed to ongoing uncertainties surrounding the approval timeline for semiconductor export licenses under current U.S. restrictions.

Analysts from KeyBanc suggest that if revenue from China-specific chips like H20 and RTX6000D (B40) were included, it could add an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in incremental revenue to NVIDIA's guidance. This implies that the reported guidance, if it indeed excludes China, could appear $2-3 billion lower than what it would be otherwise, potentially surprising some investors who might not fully factor in this explicit exclusion.

Current market expectations for NVIDIA's Q3 revenue guidance show a notable divergence. While some reports indicate a consensus around $45.92 billion, other "street" estimates are significantly higher, ranging from $52.5 billion to $57 billion, with some expecting a guide near $55 billion. This wide range suggests that not all market participants are aligned on the potential impact of China restrictions or the underlying growth drivers. If NVIDIA's guidance comes in at the lower end of these expectations, particularly if it explicitly states the exclusion of China revenue, it could lead to a market reaction.

Despite the China headwinds, underlying business fundamentals appear robust. GPU supply reportedly increased by 40% in Q2 FY2026 and is projected to rise another 20% in Q3 FY2026, driven by the ramp-up of the B200. The more advanced B300 chip is also expected to begin shipping in October, accounting for a significant portion of Blackwell series shipments. Furthermore, manufacturing yield rates for GB200 server racks are improving, with year-end shipment forecasts revised upwards. These positive supply-side developments and strong demand for the Blackwell platform could provide a floor for guidance, even with the China exclusion.

The material, non-consensus information centers on the *explicit communication* of China revenue exclusion and the quantified impact, which could lead to a lower-than-some-expect headline guidance figure for Q3 FY2026, even if the underlying demand ex-China remains strong.

### Structured Findings

**1. Potential Exclusion of China Revenue from Q3 Guidance**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia may temporarily exclude direct revenue from the China market in its next fiscal quarter's guidance. This decision stems from the uncertainty surrounding the approval timeline for semiconductor export licenses under current U.S. export restrictions. Analysts from KeyBanc suggest that if the revenue from chips such as H20 and RTX6000D (B40) in the China market were included, it could potentially add 2 billion to 3 billion dollars in incremental revenue for Nvidia."

*   **Impact:** High. Reasoning: This is a direct, quantified "whisper number" regarding how NVIDIA might present its guidance. If the company explicitly excludes China revenue, the headline guidance figure will be $2-3 billion lower than if it were included, potentially leading to a negative market reaction if not fully anticipated and understood.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While China restrictions are known, the explicit *exclusion* from guidance and the specific dollar impact are not universally priced in, especially given the range of street estimates. KeyBanc is a primary source for this specific detail.

**2. Divergent Q3 FY2026 Revenue Guidance Expectations**

*   **Snippet:** "Currently, market expectations for Nvidia's third-quarter revenue stand at 45.92 billion dollars, with an expected earnings per share of 1.01 dollars."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-20
*   **Source:** AInvest, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEGIVLmpLBo11o6epnWzpzORUCRd1Cc2JlBcxcRsNrf0H5JPAD49z8lMsBInBDeyAnlYHHtSac6iLgUTOnZAvZxaU7eyniiCM8UK15jarwOd9HMCaVfsYmWH8PcM5AdJF8_uKmOt-Ds9-3JQObi0D9_mGwSCu6p5696_ACnas2Pvin8OHndqY-JBXISyJOytIVIJF5Pcd9cHXY=
*   **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: This provides a baseline consensus figure. Any deviation from this, especially if lower due to China exclusion, would be material.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This represents a general market expectation.

*   **Snippet:** "Some on the street expect Q3 FY2026 revenue guide near $55 billion with EPS around $1.25 as Blackwell shipments increase and networking mix rises."

*   **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: While not directly a whisper number for revenue, this provides crucial context on NVIDIA's ability to meet demand. Strong supply improvements could mitigate concerns if headline guidance is impacted by China exclusion.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The Blackwell ramp is a known positive, but specific percentage increases in GPU supply for Q2 and Q3 are valuable details.

**4. GB200 Server Rack Production Improvements**

*   **Snippet:** "The report notes that the manufacturing yield rate for GB200 server racks by server ODM manufacturers has approached 85%, with the expected shipment volume for the year-end reaching 15,000 to 17,000 units. Consequently, the full-year shipment forecast for GB200 server racks has been revised upwards from 25,000 to 30,000 units."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-20
*   **Source:** AInvest, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEGIVLmpLBo11o6epnWzpzORUCRd1Cc2JlBcxcRsNrf0H5JPAD49z8lMsBInBDeyAnlYHHtSac6iLgUTOnZAvZxaU7eyniiCM8UK15jarwOd9HMCaVfsYmWH8PcM5AdJF8_uKmOt-Ds9-3JQObi0D9_mGwSCu6p5696_ACnas2Pvin8OHndqY-JBXISyJOytIVIJF5Pcd9cHXY=
*   **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: Similar to GPU supply, this indicates strong execution and increasing capacity for high-value products, which supports long-term revenue growth and could offset short-term China-related impacts on guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. While the importance of GB200 is known, the specific yield rates and revised shipment forecasts are more granular, potentially non-consensus details.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction in Q3 Revenue Expectations:** The most significant contradiction lies in the range of Q3 FY2026 revenue expectations. The "market expectations" of $45.92 billion are considerably lower than the "street" expectations of $52.5 billion to $57 billion or "near $55 billion". This gap of $7-11 billion highlights a lack of consensus on the magnitude of NVIDIA's forward guidance, especially considering the potential exclusion of China revenue.
*   **Gap in Explicit "Ex-China" Guidance:** While KeyBanc suggests NVIDIA *may* exclude China revenue and quantifies its potential impact, there isn't a widely circulated "whisper number" for Q3 revenue *explicitly stated as excluding China* from a non-NVIDIA source. The current "market expectations" and "street expectations" might or might not implicitly account for this exclusion, creating ambiguity. NVIDIA's actual guidance will clarify this.
*   **Outlier Guidance:** The mention of "NVIDIA's guidance for Q3 ($32.5 billion, ±2%)" in one snippet appears to be an outlier or a misinterpretation, as it is significantly lower than all other consensus and unofficial estimates. This should be disregarded unless corroborated by other sources.
