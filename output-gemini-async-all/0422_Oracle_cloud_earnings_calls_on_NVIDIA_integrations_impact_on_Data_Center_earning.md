## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I've identified several material, non-consensus data points regarding Oracle's cloud earnings calls and their impact on NVIDIA's Data Center segment. NVIDIA is reporting Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, for the quarter ending July 2025. The information below is filtered to content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Oracle's recent financial disclosures and strategic announcements underscore a rapidly accelerating demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure, particularly the high-end GB200 and H100 GPUs. Oracle's Q4 FY2025 earnings call and subsequent reports highlight a significant commitment to building out its AI-driven cloud infrastructure (OCI), with explicit and substantial investments in NVIDIA's technology.

The most impactful finding is Oracle's planned $40 billion investment in approximately 400,000 NVIDIA GB200 chips for the "Stargate" project, a massive AI data center initiative. This is a colossal order that solidifies NVIDIA's position as the dominant AI chip provider and provides a clear revenue pipeline. Furthermore, OpenAI's decision to partner with Oracle for its next-generation AI models, utilizing NVIDIA's GB200 chips, signifies a diversification away from exclusive reliance on other hyperscalers and directly benefits NVIDIA through Oracle's procurement.

Oracle's reported 52% year-over-year growth in OCI revenue for Q4 FY2025, coupled with a staggering 336% increase in GPU consumption, demonstrates the immediate and intense demand for AI compute. Oracle's projection of over 70% growth in cloud infrastructure for FY2026, driven by AI and Stargate, provides strong forward-looking indicators for NVIDIA's Data Center revenue. The fact that Oracle is experiencing supply constraints and scheduling customers into the future, despite its massive CapEx plans (over $25 billion in FY2026), suggests that the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs continues to outstrip supply, indicating sustained pricing power and robust order backlogs for NVIDIA.

While NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 earnings already acknowledged the integration with Oracle and the availability of Blackwell instances, the sheer scale of Oracle's recent commitments and the specific details of the Stargate project, especially with OpenAI's direct involvement, likely represent a non-consensus upside for NVIDIA's future guidance. This strong demand from a major cloud provider like Oracle helps to offset some of the geopolitical headwinds NVIDIA faces in the China market.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "Oracle's $40 billion chip order—equivalent to 400,000 GB200 units—ensures it remains at the forefront of AI innovation."
- **Date:** 2025-08-20
- **Source:** Oracle's Strategic Cloud Turnaround: A $500B AI Megadeal with OpenAI and Nvidia, (Source not explicitly a publication, but an analysis of Oracle's strategy)
- **Impact:** High. This represents a massive, concrete order for NVIDIA's most advanced chips, directly impacting future revenue and solidifying its market dominance. The scale of this order is likely to significantly influence NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the Oracle-NVIDIA partnership is known, the specific $40 billion, 400,000 GB200 unit order for the Stargate project, and its implications for NVIDIA's revenue pipeline, may not be fully appreciated or priced in by all investors.

- **Snippet:** "Oracle's cloud infrastructure (IaaS) revenue hit $3.0 billion in Q4 2025, a 52% year-over-year increase. This growth is fueled by surging demand for AI-driven workloads, with GPU consumption in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) rising by 336% in the same period."
- **Date:** 2025-08-20
- **Source:** Oracle's Strategic Cloud Turnaround: A $500B AI Megadeal with OpenAI and Nvidia, (Source not explicitly a publication, but an analysis of Oracle's strategy)
- **Impact:** High. The substantial year-over-year growth in OCI revenue and the dramatic increase in GPU consumption directly translate to increased demand for NVIDIA's data center products. This indicates a very strong underlying market for NVIDIA.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known in terms of general OCI growth, but the specific 336% GPU consumption growth figure and its direct link to NVIDIA's demand might be underappreciated by some.

- **Snippet:** "CEO Safra Catz has projected 70%+ growth in cloud infrastructure for FY2026, driven by AI demand and Stargate's rollout."
- **Date:** 2025-08-20
- **Source:** Oracle's Strategic Cloud Turnaround: A $500B AI Megadeal with OpenAI and Nvidia, (Source not explicitly a publication, but an analysis of Oracle's strategy)
- **Impact:** High. Oracle's aggressive FY2026 guidance for cloud infrastructure, explicitly tied to AI and the Stargate project, provides a strong leading indicator for sustained high demand for NVIDIA's GPUs and networking solutions.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Oracle's bullish outlook is known, the direct implication of 70%+ cloud infrastructure growth for NVIDIA's specific revenue streams might not be fully factored into NVIDIA's consensus estimates.

- **Snippet:** "The company is facing supply constraints, unable to meet the high demand for its cloud services, leading to scheduling customers into the future. CapEx is expected to increase further to over $25 billion in FY26, which may strain financial resources."
- **Date:** 2025-06-11
- **Source:** Q4 2025 Oracle Corp Earnings Call Transcript, GuruFocus
- **Impact:** Medium. Oracle's inability to meet demand due to supply constraints, despite massive CapEx, indicates that the demand for AI infrastructure (and thus NVIDIA's components) is exceptionally strong and continues to outstrip available supply. This suggests sustained pricing power and a robust backlog for NVIDIA.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general supply constraints in the AI market are known, Oracle specifically stating they are "unable to meet the high demand for its cloud services" and "scheduling customers into the future" provides a more granular and impactful view of the demand-supply imbalance directly benefiting NVIDIA.

- **Snippet:** "OpenAI said last month that Oracle had delivered the first Nvidia GB200 racks and that they were being used for 'running early training and inference workloads.'"
- **Date:** 2025-08-23
- **Source:** AI Data Centers Are Coming for Your Land, Water and Power, CNET
- **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the operationalization of NVIDIA's GB200 systems within Oracle's infrastructure for a key AI customer (OpenAI). It validates the demand and deployment of NVIDIA's latest technology, moving beyond just orders to actual usage.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known that OpenAI is a major AI player, but the specific detail of Oracle delivering the first GB200 racks for OpenAI's workloads and its recency might be a slightly overlooked confirmation of the partnership's progress.

- **Snippet:** "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) announced the release of NVIDIA L40S GPU bare-metal instances, available to order and the upcoming availability of a new virtual machine accelerated by a single NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. This new VM expands OCI's existing H100 portfolio, which includes an NVIDIA HGX H100 8-GPU bare-metal instance."
- **Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Source:** Oracle and NVIDIA Meet the Demands for GenAI with Latest Infrastructure Releases
- **Impact:** Medium. The continuous expansion of NVIDIA GPU offerings on OCI, including the latest L40S and H100 instances, demonstrates ongoing integration and a diversified product offering from NVIDIA to meet various AI workload demands on Oracle's platform.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known that OCI offers NVIDIA GPUs, but the specific new offerings (L40S, single H100 VM) and their availability within the last three months reinforce the ongoing demand and partnership.
