## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to release its Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into the adoption rates and strategic impact of its Grace CPU reveals several material, non-consensus insights that could influence the company's performance and forward-looking guidance. While much of the market's attention remains on NVIDIA's GPU dominance, the increasing traction of its Grace CPU, both as a standalone unit and integrated into its Superchips, signals a significant diversification of its Data Center business and a strengthening competitive moat.

Recent reports indicate a substantial surge in Arm-based server CPU market share, largely attributed to NVIDIA's Grace CPUs. This growth is not confined to high-end AI supercomputing but extends into critical areas like edge, telco, and storage, driven by the Grace CPU C1 variant's energy efficiency and performance. This diversification, coupled with the full-scale production of Grace Blackwell platforms, suggests a broader and potentially underestimated revenue stream for NVIDIA's Data Center segment.

However, a potential technical nuance regarding Grace CPU's lack of CXL support could be a point of discussion, though NVIDIA appears to be strategically navigating this to maintain control over its ecosystem. The overall picture points to a robust and expanding role for Grace CPUs in the evolving data center landscape, which could provide a positive surprise in NVIDIA's upcoming earnings and guidance.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: Significant Surge in Arm Server CPU Market Share Driven by NVIDIA Grace**

Jensen Huang's statement about "full-scale production" indicates that the Grace CPUs, as a critical component of these systems, are being shipped in high volumes, directly contributing to NVIDIA's Data Center revenue.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that Blackwell is ramping, but the direct implication for Grace CPU volume and its contribution to the "full-scale production" might be underemphasized in the broader market narrative which often focuses on the Blackwell GPU itself.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Specific Grace CPU Revenue:** A notable gap is the lack of specific revenue breakdown for Grace CPUs as standalone products versus their contribution within integrated systems like Grace Hopper or Grace Blackwell. While the market share data and adoption rates are strong indicators, a direct revenue figure would provide more precise insight.
*   **CXL Support:** The article from December 2024 mentions that "NVIDIA Grace Does Not Support CXL?" and discusses potential limitations with PCIe lanes. While the article frames this as a strategic choice for NVIDIA to control its ecosystem, it could be a point of contention or a perceived technical gap by some customers or analysts. However, the strong adoption rates suggest it's not a major impediment currently.
*   **Long-term Competitive Landscape:** While the current focus is on NVIDIA's strong position, the mention of a "Rising ASIC coalition" seeking to jettison NVIDIA suggests potential long-term competitive pressures from custom AI chips, which could impact Grace CPU adoption in the distant future, but is less relevant for the immediate Q2 earnings and Q3 guidance.
