## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have gathered and analyzed recent data on the company's short interest and the cost to borrow its shares, focusing on information published within the last three months. NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, after market close.

The overall picture suggests a relatively low and declining short interest, coupled with a low cost to borrow shares. This indicates that short sellers are not aggressively betting against NVIDIA, or have been covering their positions ahead of the earnings report. While the data itself is generally publicly available, the interpretation of these trends in the context of NVIDIA's high valuation and significant market expectations could be considered non-consensus, as it suggests a lack of conviction among short sellers to challenge the prevailing bullish narrative.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: Declining Short Interest Ahead of Earnings**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA (NVDA) has a short interest of 192.12 million shares, representing 0.82% of the float... This marks a -4.73% decrease in short interest from the previous month. The short interest ratio (days to cover) is 1.0, indicating that it would take 1.0 days of the average trading volume of 237.93 million shares to cover all short positions." "Short interest in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) decreased during the last reporting period, falling from 201.66M to 192.12M. This put 0.82% of the company's publicly available shares short." The settlement date for this data was July 31, 2025, with dissemination on August 11, 2025.
*   **Date:** August 11, 2025 (dissemination date for July 31, 2025 settlement)
*   **Source:** MarketBeat, Benzinga, Nasdaq, ChartExchange, FINVIZ.com
*   **Impact:** Medium (65) - A declining short interest suggests that fewer investors are betting against NVIDIA's stock, potentially reducing the likelihood of a significant short squeeze post-earnings. It could also imply that previous short positions have been covered, removing a potential buying catalyst. The very low percentage of float shorted (0.82%) and days to cover (1.0-1.23) further reinforce this.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely Known - The raw short interest numbers are regularly published by financial data providers. However, the implication that short sellers are not increasing their bets despite high valuation concerns could be overlooked by those solely focused on the bullish narrative.

---

**Finding 2: Consistently Low Cost to Borrow Shares**

*   **Snippet:** "As of 2025-08-24 11:47:04 PM EDT, there were 10,000,000 shares available with a fee of 0.41%." Another source states, "NVIDIA CORP currently has a borrow fee rate of 0.41% with 10M shares available to borrow." Earlier in August, the borrow fee was noted at 0.2500% and 0.4081% (annualized).
*   **Date:** August 24, 2025
*   **Source:** ChartExchange, Companies Market Cap, Short Interest Tracker
*   **Impact:** Low (40) - A consistently low cost to borrow (around 0.41% annualized) indicates that there is ample supply of NVIDIA shares available for lending, and demand from short sellers is not high. This further supports the idea that short sellers are not aggressively targeting NVDA, which could be seen as a neutral to slightly bullish signal. While there was a slight increase from 0.25% to 0.41% in mid-August, it remains a very low rate overall.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely Known - Cost to borrow data is generally available, but its low level might be overlooked in the broader discussion of NVIDIA's market dynamics.

---

**Finding 3: Comparison to Peers and Broader Market Sentiment**

*   **Snippet:** "According to Benzinga Pro, NVIDIA's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.38%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers."
*   **Date:** August 11, 2025 (implied by short interest report date)
*   **Source:** Benzinga
*   **Impact:** Medium (50) - NVIDIA's significantly lower short interest compared to its peer group average (0.82% vs. 5.38%) suggests that despite its high valuation and "AI bubble" concerns, short sellers are less inclined to bet against NVIDIA specifically. This could imply a stronger underlying conviction in NVIDIA's business model and future prospects among a broader set of market participants, even those who might typically short overvalued stocks in the sector. This could be a subtle positive signal for investor confidence going into earnings.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked - While peer comparisons are common, this specific data point highlighting NVIDIA's *lower* short interest relative to its peers, especially in the context of its high valuation, might not be a widely emphasized narrative.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Days to Cover Variation:** There is a slight variation in "days to cover" across different sources (1.0, 1.23, 0.99, 1.22967). This is likely due to different methodologies for calculating average daily trading volume, but the overall implication of a very short period to cover remains consistent.
*   **Non-Consensus Sources:** While I prioritized finding non-consensus information, the nature of short interest and cost to borrow data means it is primarily reported by mainstream financial data providers. The "non-consensus" aspect largely stems from the *interpretation* of this widely available data, rather than from niche, proprietary sources. The Interactive Brokers article provided a qualitative statement about "NVDA Demand is the weakest since May and Supply is about 55%. That's a SHORT bias," which is more opinion-based and less directly tied to the quantitative short interest and cost to borrow data.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report is being approached by the market with a notable absence of aggressive short-selling activity. The latest data, as of July 31, 2025, shows a short interest of approximately 192 million shares, representing a mere 0.82% of the company's free float. This figure has seen a decline of nearly 5% from the previous month, indicating that short sellers have been reducing their positions. The "days to cover" ratio, which estimates how long it would take for short sellers to buy back all borrowed shares, stands at a very low 1.0 to 1.23 days, suggesting minimal risk of a short squeeze.

Furthermore, the cost to borrow NVIDIA shares remains exceptionally low, currently at around 0.41% annualized, with a healthy supply of 10 million shares available for lending as of August 24, 2025. While there was a minor uptick in the borrow fee in mid-August, it still signifies a lack of strong demand from short sellers.

This low and declining short interest, coupled with a cheap cost to borrow, presents a subtle but potentially significant non-consensus insight. Despite ongoing discussions about NVIDIA's lofty valuation and potential "AI bubble" concerns, the short-selling community is not actively betting against the stock. In fact, NVIDIA's short interest is considerably lower than the average for its semiconductor peers. This could imply that even skeptical investors are hesitant to short NVIDIA, perhaps due to the company's dominant position in the AI market and its strong growth trajectory. For the upcoming earnings, this suggests that a significant short-covering rally is unlikely to be a major catalyst, but it also removes a potential overhang of aggressive bearish sentiment. The market appears to be largely accepting of NVIDIA's current valuation, or at least unwilling to challenge it through short positions.
