## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have identified material, non-consensus information regarding the sell-through rate of NVIDIA H20 chips at major Chinese cloud providers in the last 30 days. While direct "sell-through rate" data is not publicly available, recent reports indicate significant headwinds that are likely to negatively impact NVIDIA's H20 sales in China, potentially affecting forward-looking guidance.

Initial optimism surrounding the resumption of H20 chip sales to China, following a U.S. government agreement for a 15% revenue share, has been largely overshadowed by recent actions from Chinese regulators. These developments suggest a much weaker demand environment for H20 chips in China than previously anticipated, creating a non-consensus view that could surprise investors.

### Structured Findings:

**Finding 1: Chinese Regulators Order Halt on H20 Purchases**
*   **Snippet:** "Sales from China have likely slowed down since the country's cyberspace regulator warned of national security concerns tied to the H20 chip. Chinese regulators then cautioned domestic firms such as ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent against buying H20, before issuing a stricter order to halt purchases pending a full national security review."

*   **Impact:** High. This directly indicates a severe impediment to H20 sell-through at major Chinese cloud providers, impacting current and future revenue from this segment.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the U.S. deal to resume sales was known, the swift and strong negative reaction from Chinese regulators, culminating in orders to halt purchases, is a significant non-consensus development.

**Finding 2: H20 Inventory Backlog and Production Slowdown**
*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA has asked suppliers Foxconn, Amkor Technology, and Samsung Electronics to stop work relating to the H20 chip, according to reports from Reuters and The Information. Huang told reporters in Taipei that his company has a backlog of these chips and is waiting for more orders from Chinese customers before it buys more components, according to Reuters."

*   **Impact:** High. An existing backlog and halted production directly indicate a lack of demand and poor sell-through for H20 chips in China, contradicting any expectation of significant revenue contribution from this segment in the near term.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This directly challenges the narrative that the U.S. export license would immediately translate into strong sales.

**Finding 3: H20 Revenue Contribution to Q2 and Q3 Guidance**
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia said in May that the H20 could have added $8 billion to Q2 revenue. But that was before the U.S. added license restrictions and China started pushing its cloud providers to use domestic chips like those from Huawei. As a result, Nvidia excluded H20 from its Q2 guidance and is unlikely to include it in Q3 either."

*   **Impact:** High. This confirms that H20 sales are not expected to contribute to Q2 FY2026 revenue and are unlikely to impact Q3 positively, directly addressing the query's timeframe and impact on earnings.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known for Q2, but the unlikelihood for Q3 due to recent Chinese actions is becoming a non-consensus concern.

**Finding 4: Development of a New China-Specific Chip (B30A)**
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia is developing a new AI chip for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be more powerful than the H20 model it is currently allowed to sell there, two people briefed on the matter said. The new chip, tentatively known as the B30A, will use a single-die design that is likely to deliver half the raw computing power of the more sophisticated dual-die configuration in Nvidia's flagship B300 accelerator card."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While not directly impacting Q2, this signals NVIDIA's long-term strategy to address the challenging Chinese market, implying that the H20 is not a sustainable solution and that the company is actively seeking alternatives due to the current difficulties.
*   **Consensus Check:** Becoming more widely known, but the implications for H20's immediate future are still underappreciated.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The initial reports in mid-July 2025 indicated that the U.S. had approved H20 sales to China, leading to some analyst optimism and a surge in Chinese cloud provider stocks. However, this was quickly contradicted by the Chinese government's actions in late July and August, raising security concerns and ordering a halt to purchases.
*   **Gap:** Precise "sell-through rate" numbers for H20 chips at specific Chinese cloud providers are not available in public reports. The information is more qualitative, indicating a significant slowdown or halt in purchases rather than specific unit sales.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance are likely to be significantly impacted by the highly volatile situation surrounding its H20 chips in China. While a deal was struck in July 2025 to allow H20 sales to China with a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government, the subsequent reaction from Chinese regulators has created a substantial headwind.

In the last 30 days, particularly in August 2025, reports emerged that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) raised national security concerns about the H20 chip and subsequently "cautioned" or "ordered" major Chinese cloud providers like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent to halt their purchases. This direct intervention from the Chinese government is a critical, non-consensus development that directly impedes the sell-through of H20 chips.

As a result of this pushback, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has acknowledged a "backlog" of H20 chips and has reportedly asked suppliers to stop production work, indicating a severe lack of demand from Chinese customers. This directly contradicts any lingering optimism that the U.S. export license would lead to a robust recovery in H20 sales for the quarter ending July 2025 or the current quarter.

NVIDIA had already excluded the potential $8 billion in H20 revenue from its Q2 guidance due to earlier restrictions, and it is now unlikely to include it in Q3 guidance either, given the latest developments. This suggests that the H20 chip, designed as a China-compliant alternative, is facing significant challenges in gaining traction in the crucial Chinese market.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA is reportedly developing a new, more powerful Blackwell-based chip for China, tentatively named B30A, which would still comply with export restrictions. This strategic pivot underscores the difficulties with the H20 and indicates NVIDIA's long-term commitment to the Chinese market, albeit with adapted products. However, the B30A's approval and market adoption remain uncertain.

In conclusion, the "sell-through rate" of NVIDIA H20 chips at major Chinese cloud providers in the last 30 days is likely to be extremely low, if not halted entirely, due to direct government intervention. This non-consensus information presents a significant downside risk to NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance, as the expected revenue contribution from H20 sales in China is now highly questionable for the coming quarters.
