## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective is to identify material, non-consensus information likely to impact the upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. NVIDIA reports earnings for the quarter ending July 2025 today, August 27, 2025.

While direct, aggregated "GPU utilization dashboards from HPC centers (queue wait times); MoM trend since June" are not publicly available, the research uncovered several indirect indicators and specific operational details that offer non-consensus insights into GPU demand, supply, and infrastructure constraints. The overall market sentiment remains highly bullish on NVIDIA's AI-driven growth, but specific data points suggest nuances in supply availability and broader infrastructure challenges that could influence future performance.

### Structured Findings:

**1. Finding: Genesis Cloud Offers "Instant Access" to NVIDIA H100 GPUs in June 2025**
*   **Snippet:** "Here's the reality: the NVIDIA H100 isn't just available, it's the most production-ready, high-performance GPU on the market today. And at Genesis Cloud, we make it available instantly: No waitlists, no contracts, no vendor lock-in."
*   **Date:** June 13, 2025
*   **Source:** Genesis Cloud, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGW5VMVZ5z3JLoWrx2dydYAVs8e1NNyDoS-DQUK91xDx0W6SP33ZBSEtjw72O-ywQrWoweLgXQqKZr-sOwD7SIB7Q5Khgce8MSpFkaFfu5KQEU75kOY8etpB5KsuMvm_AzmYcASJ4nWaRN_MmvuMuJa](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGW5VMVZ5z3JLoWrx2dydYAVs8e1NNyDoS-DQUK91xDx0W6SP33ZBSEtjw72O-ywQrWoweLgXQqKZr-sOwD7SIB7Q5Khgce8MSpFkaFfu5KQEU75kOY8etpB5KsuMvm_AzmYcASJ4nWaRN_MmvuMuJa)
*   **Impact:** High. This directly contradicts the widely held belief of a severe, universal shortage of H100 GPUs and long waitlists. If other smaller cloud providers also have immediate availability, it could indicate that the supply crunch for H100s is easing faster than generally believed, potentially impacting NVIDIA's pricing power or the urgency for customers to transition to newer Blackwell GPUs.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The prevailing consensus is that H100s are still in extremely high demand with significant lead times. This snippet presents a non-consensus view from a specific cloud provider.

**2. Finding: AWS Launches Single-GPU P5 Instances with NVIDIA H100 in August 2025**
*   **Snippet:** "AWS has launched single-GPU P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, announced on August 12, 2025, for flexible, cost-effective AI and HPC workloads. These offer up to 96 vCPUs and 768 GB memory, enabling up to 70% savings over multi-GPU setups. This democratizes access for smaller teams and experimental projects."
*   **Date:** August 12, 2025

*   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates an expansion of H100 availability and accessibility, particularly for smaller-scale users and projects. While not directly addressing queue times on large HPC clusters, it suggests that the overall market for H100 access is becoming more flexible and potentially less constrained for certain use cases. This could broaden NVIDIA's customer base but also distribute demand more widely.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While AWS's offerings are known, the specific launch of single-GPU H100 instances and their potential to democratize access might be overlooked in the broader narrative of hyperscaler demand for massive clusters.

**3. Finding: Oregon State University HPC Cluster Operational Details (June-August 2025)**
*   **Snippet:** "The Multi-instance GPU (MIG) feature of the H100 GPU has been enabled on some of the dgxh nodes. The MIG feature will allow more efficient use of the H100 GPUs, and will shorten waiting times." (April 10, 2025, updated June 3, 2025). "The COE cluster is back online and most compute resources have been restored." (June 18, 2025). "A power outage is planned for KEC for Friday, August 1. The building will be closed that day. All DGX-2 and DGX-H100 nodes will be without power that day, and the cluster will run at greatly reduced capacity through the weekend." (July 29, 2025, referring to August 1).
*   **Date:** April 10, 2025 - August 1, 2025 (various updates)
*   **Source:** Oregon State University, Information Technology and Computing Support, [https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/hpc/status](https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/hpc/status)
*   **Impact:** Medium. This provides specific, real-world insights into the operational challenges and management strategies of an HPC center. The enablement of MIG to "shorten waiting times" suggests that queue times were a concern. The temporary "reduced capacity" due to power outages and maintenance in July/August would have directly increased queue times for users of this specific cluster. This granular data, while small-scale, offers a tangible glimpse into actual utilization dynamics.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This is highly specific, non-aggregated data from a university HPC center, unlikely to be factored into broader market consensus.

**4. Finding: North America Data Center Availability Crisis and Power Delays (August 2025)**
*   **Snippet:** "The North America data center colocation market has reached a critical tipping point, with vacancy rates plummeting to an unprecedented 2.3 percent amid relentless demand for digital infrastructure... The average wait time for a grid connection across the U.S. is now four years. Power delays remain a significant hurdle in alleviating supply constraints."
*   **Date:** August 18, 2025
*   **Source:** HPCwire (citing JLL's "North America Data Center Report – Midyear 2025"), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHpAjHznoM26iGC5tz9RHb-srSjykfuBhtgdrZzxZFgKjYT9Tg3jPuoh6oB3E1FVgrdYk6Ceenk4lXOhpNw--GZo4ThfohHr3Vsfgqm56ExaBiVZbcWlJWIO1Qlp2846MYxVolojqkKjBOsKvnYHvMWtiulURp6PZqz_BT6iYALqG](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHpAjHznoM26iGC5tz9RHb-srSjykfuBhtgdrZzxZFgKjYT9Tg3jPuoh6oB3E1FVgrdYk6Ceenk4lXOhpNw--GZo4ThfohHr3Vsfgqm56ExaBiVZbcWlJWIO1Qlp2846MYxVolojqkKjBOsKvnXHvMWtiulURp6PZqz_BT6iYALqG)
*   **Impact:** High. While not directly about GPU utilization, this is a material, non-consensus factor that significantly impacts the overall ability to deploy and scale AI infrastructure, including NVIDIA's GPUs. A four-year wait for grid connections means that even if NVIDIA can supply chips, the physical infrastructure to house and power them faces severe bottlenecks. This could constrain future growth in data center deployments.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While power constraints are generally acknowledged, the severity of the "four-year wait time" for grid connections and the "2.3 percent" vacancy rate in data centers might not be fully priced into NVIDIA's growth expectations.

**5. Finding: IREN's Significant Blackwell GPU Purchases in July and August 2025**
*   **Snippet:** "IREN is expanding its GPU fleet with the purchase of an additional 4.2k Blackwell B200 GPUs from NVIDIA NVDA to be installed at IREN's Prince George campus. This doubles down IREN Limited's total fleet to approximately 8.5k NVIDIA GPUs... In July 2025, IREN bought 2,400 Blackwell GPUs (1,300 B200 + 1,100 B300) for roughly $130 million. These will be installed over the coming months..."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025 (reporting on July 2025 purchases)
*   **Source:** Nasdaq, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQErhVYXwjEF91XHxy-yjIYbte0ZW6jOFAzua1CGY6ibscXwctJzQ1a0uasaJwU4-_3AmIPIEg_hITg5TQJQEWhWYqcEhZfrwZ8b3_oXYnexd-saY8f1Wadup9f67Oc3sxLes-29quyTyWPtqe0joGOb2gmvQYuVUsaYTB2_8IbSVTr41xXjW18ZSTFC7O-uafkpTZE=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQErhVYXwjEF91XHxy-yjIYbte0ZW6jOFAzua1CGY6ibscXwctJzQ1a0uasaJwU4-_3AmIPIEg_hITg5TQJQEWhWYqcEhZfrwZ8b3_oXYnexd-saY8f1Wadup9f67Oc3sxLes-29quyTyWPtqe0joGOb2gmvQYuVUsaYTB2_8IbSVTr41xXjW18ZSTFC7O-uafkpTZE=)
*   **Impact:** High. This demonstrates continued, substantial demand for NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture from a large-scale operator, even before the chips are fully installed. It reinforces the strong forward-looking demand for NVIDIA's cutting-edge GPUs, which is a key driver for future revenue and guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known (strong Blackwell demand) but the specific scale of IREN's purchases and their timing (July/August for "coming months" installation) provides concrete data points that might not be fully integrated into all consensus models.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction in H100 Availability:** There's a notable contradiction between Genesis Cloud's claim of "instant access" to H100s in June and the broader market narrative of "Limited GPU Availability" and "frequent stockouts" for high-end GPUs like H100/A100 as late as August. This suggests that while overall demand is high, supply might be more fragmented or that some providers have managed to secure significant inventory. This could lead to varied experiences for customers and potentially impact pricing dynamics in different segments of the cloud GPU market.
*   **Gap in Direct MoM Trends:** Despite targeted searches, no public "GPU utilization dashboards" or "MoM trend since June" for queue wait times across multiple HPC centers were found. The available information is either general market commentary, specific operational updates from a single institution, or older academic studies on utilization challenges. This indicates a significant data gap for the precise query.

**Overall Analysis:**

The research indicates that while the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, particularly the H100 and upcoming Blackwell architecture, remains exceptionally strong, there are emerging nuances in the supply-demand dynamics. The "instant access" claims from some cloud providers and the introduction of single-GPU H100 instances by AWS suggest that H100 availability might be improving or becoming more democratized, potentially easing some of the extreme queue times seen previously. However, the broader infrastructure constraints, such as data center availability and power grid connection delays, present a significant long-term challenge to the expansion of AI computing capacity, regardless of NVIDIA's chip supply. The continued large-scale purchases of Blackwell GPUs by operators like IREN underscore the robust forward-looking demand for NVIDIA's next-generation products.

For NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings, the strong demand for Blackwell and continued, albeit potentially easing, demand for H100s are likely to be positive. However, any commentary on the pace of H100 supply normalization, the impact of broader data center infrastructure constraints, or the competitive landscape in cloud GPU offerings could provide non-consensus insights that move the stock. The market will be looking for confirmation of sustained strong demand and clear guidance on the Blackwell ramp-up, but any mention of easing H100 shortages or the impact of power infrastructure bottlenecks could be material.
