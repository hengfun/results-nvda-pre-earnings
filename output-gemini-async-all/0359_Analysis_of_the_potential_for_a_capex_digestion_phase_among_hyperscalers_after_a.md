## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the potential for a "capex digestion" phase among hyperscalers and its likely impact on NVIDIA's upcoming earnings, focusing on material, non-consensus information.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The prevailing sentiment among analysts and in recent reports is that hyperscaler capital expenditure (capex) on AI infrastructure remains robust, with many major cloud providers continuing to increase or reiterate strong spending plans for 2025 and 2026. This suggests that a widespread "capex digestion" phase, where hyperscalers significantly pull back on AI investments, is not currently anticipated by the market. NVIDIA is consistently highlighted as the primary beneficiary of this spending, with strong demand for its Blackwell and upcoming Rubin architectures.

However, a potentially non-consensus data point has emerged regarding TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging capacity utilization. Reports from early August 2025 suggest that CoWoS capacity is operating at only 60%, which could indicate a short-term supply-demand mismatch or an adjustment in wafer starts from key clients like NVIDIA. This contrasts with earlier narratives of persistent CoWoS bottlenecks and insatiable demand. If this lower utilization is accurate and sustained, it could signal a more nuanced demand picture than the uniformly bullish outlook, potentially impacting NVIDIA's near-term revenue or gross margins if it leads to lower-than-expected shipments of its most advanced, CoWoS-dependent chips.

Other factors to consider include the increasing trend of hyperscalers developing their own custom AI chips (e.g., Meta's Artemis, Amazon's Trainium2/Inferentia3, Google's TPU v6). While this vertical integration is a long-term trend that could eventually impact NVIDIA's market share, current reports suggest that demand for NVIDIA's offerings remains strong even alongside these in-house efforts. Geopolitical tensions and export restrictions, particularly concerning the China market, also remain a persistent wildcard for NVIDIA's revenue.

Overall, while the market is largely optimistic about NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings, the reported CoWoS utilization rate presents a potential crack in the "insatiable demand" narrative that warrants close attention.

**Structured Findings:**

**Finding 1: TSMC CoWoS Capacity Utilization Reportedly at 60%**

*   **Snippet:** "Reports have emerged that TSMC's advanced packaging technology, CoWoS, is operating at only 60% capacity utilization. Such a supply-demand mismatch has confused the supply chain." "Supply chain insiders suggest this situation may stem from TSMC's rapid expansion outpacing actual demand or possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients."
*   **Date:** August 5, 2025
*   **Source:** DIGITIMES Asia, Eeworld
*   **Impact:** High. If accurate and sustained, this indicates a potential near-term softening in demand for advanced AI packaging, which is crucial for NVIDIA's high-end GPUs. This could lead to lower-than-expected shipments or pricing power for NVIDIA's most advanced chips, directly impacting revenue and potentially gross margins. It contradicts the widely held belief of persistent CoWoS bottlenecks limiting NVIDIA's supply.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. Most recent analyst reports and market commentary emphasize *continued* strong demand and supply constraints for CoWoS, not underutilization. For example, a June 2025 report stated, "Despite aggressive expansions, TSMC's CoWoS capacity remains a bottleneck... TSMC admits AI chip output will remain constrained through 2025, with delays pushing back shipments for major clients like NVIDIA." This 60% utilization figure, if confirmed, would be a significant deviation from that narrative.

**Finding 2: Continued Strong Hyperscaler AI Capex and NVIDIA Demand**

*   **Snippet:** "Bank of America (BofA) analysts said in a Friday note that the outlook for data center and artificial intelligence spending demand in 2025 remained strong, citing positive recent indicators from major U.S. “hyperscalers.” BofA expects total AI capex spending at $414 billion in 2025- up 44% from last year. Capex is also set to increase to $432 billion in 2026." "Hyperscaler capex is tracking toward an unprecedented $315–$365 billion in 2025, with Wall Street models pointing to further growth into 2026." "Microsoft is capacity-constrained, AWS says it will take “several quarters” to rebalance, and Google raised its CapEx guide. As such, we believe strongly that this is not a one-quarter story; it's a multiyear power grab that will determine margin structures and cash flow for the next cycle."
*   **Date:** May 12, 2025, August 9, 2025, August 26, 2025
*   **Source:** Investing.com, SiliconANGLE, MarketPulse
*   **Impact:** Medium. This is largely consensus, reinforcing the positive demand environment for NVIDIA. However, the sheer scale of projected spending and the "multiyear power grab" framing suggest sustained, rather than digested, investment, which is material for NVIDIA's long-term outlook.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. Most analysts are bullish on hyperscaler AI spending, and this is a core part of the NVIDIA bull case. The idea of a "digestion" phase is largely being dismissed in favor of continued growth.

**Finding 3: Hyperscalers' Increasing Self-Reliance with Custom AI Chips**

*   **Snippet:** "Meta formally introduced its in-house inference chip “Artemis,” part of a broader effort to optimize LLM performance and reduce reliance on NVIDIA. ... Amazon confirmed the internal rollout of Trainium2 and Inferentia3, both designed to handle model training and inference at AWS scale. ... Google I/O 2025 introduced TPU v6 chips, co-developed with Broadcom, delivering major improvements in training and inference for large models like Gemini 2.5. The emphasis on in-house silicon aligns with ongoing hyperscaler trends toward vertical integration."
*   **Date:** August 2, 2025
*   **Source:** Semiconductor Industry Updates (S&P Global)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While current demand for NVIDIA remains strong, this trend of hyperscalers developing their own custom AI chips represents a long-term strategic shift. It could eventually lead to a moderation of NVIDIA's market share or pricing power in certain segments, though the immediate impact on Q2 FY2026 earnings is likely limited given the continued high demand for NVIDIA's advanced platforms.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but its *impact* on NVIDIA's future revenue visibility is a point of ongoing debate. While the existence of custom chips is known, the extent to which they will displace NVIDIA's offerings versus supplementing them is still evolving.

**Finding 4: Project Cancellations by US Cloud Providers, but Overall Capex on Track**

*   **Snippet:** "Despite some project cancellations by U.S. cloud providers, overall CapEx remains on track, with hyperscalers adjusting capacity rather than cutting investments."
*   **Date:** June 20, 2025
*   **Source:** CIO Dive (Dell'Oro Group research)
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium. This snippet provides a nuanced view, acknowledging some project cancellations which could be interpreted as a mini-digestion, but quickly mitigates it by stating overall capex is on track and investments are not being cut. It suggests a re-prioritization or optimization of spending rather than a broad slowdown.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially non-consensus. While the overall narrative is strong capex, specific mentions of "project cancellations" are less common and could be seen as a minor headwind, even if offset by other spending.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **TSMC CoWoS Utilization:** The most significant contradiction lies in the reported 60% CoWoS capacity utilization versus the widespread narrative of persistent CoWoS bottlenecks and aggressive expansion to meet insatiable AI demand. This gap needs clarification. If the 60% figure is accurate and reflects a current reality, it could imply a short-term oversupply in advanced packaging or a temporary slowdown in orders from key customers like NVIDIA, which would be a material, non-consensus negative. If it's a misinterpretation or a very short-lived anomaly, then the broader narrative of strong demand and supply constraints holds.
*   **"Digestion" vs. "Capacity-Constrained":** While the query specifically asked about "capex digestion," many sources describe hyperscalers as "capacity-constrained". This implies that demand *exceeds* supply, which is the opposite of a digestion phase. The Dell'Oro Group snippet about "project cancellations" hints at some digestion but frames it as capacity adjustment rather than a spending cut. The market is clearly leaning towards the "capacity-constrained" narrative.
*   **Impact of Custom Chips:** While the trend of hyperscalers developing custom AI chips is acknowledged, the precise timeline and magnitude of their impact on NVIDIA's revenue stream are still uncertain. Current reports suggest NVIDIA's demand remains strong despite these efforts, but this is a long-term risk that could become more material in future quarters.
