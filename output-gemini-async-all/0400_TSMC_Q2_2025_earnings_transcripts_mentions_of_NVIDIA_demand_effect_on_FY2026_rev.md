## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information from TSMC's Q2 2025 earnings and related reports, likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

TSMC's Q2 2025 earnings call and subsequent reports paint a highly optimistic picture for the AI semiconductor market, with strong implications for NVIDIA. TSMC significantly upgraded its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to approximately 30% growth, explicitly attributing this to robust demand in AI and advanced manufacturing nodes. This upward revision, particularly its direct linkage to AI, suggests a stronger-than-anticipated underlying demand environment that could translate into upside for NVIDIA's guidance.

A key non-consensus insight comes directly from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who revealed that TSMC is actively developing "six additional artificial intelligence products" for NVIDIA. This disclosure points to a deep and expanding product pipeline beyond currently known architectures like Blackwell, indicating sustained innovation and future revenue streams for NVIDIA. Furthermore, TSMC's ongoing efforts to "narrow the gap between the demand and the capacity" for its advanced chips, coupled with reports that NVIDIA could command a majority share of global CoWoS advanced-packaging demand through 2026, highlight persistent supply constraints that, while challenging, also underscore NVIDIA's strong pricing power and the insatiable demand for its AI accelerators.

Finally, while the H20 chip production halt for China was a known headwind, the rapid development of a new "China-compliant" B30A chip based on the Blackwell architecture and the potential to monetize approximately $10 billion of H20 inventory suggest a quicker-than-expected recovery and adaptation to geopolitical challenges, potentially mitigating the long-term impact on NVIDIA's China revenue.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Impact:** High. TSMC's upgraded FY2025 revenue guidance, explicitly tied to AI and advanced nodes, is a strong positive indicator for NVIDIA, its primary advanced AI chip customer. This suggests robust underlying demand that could lead to NVIDIA raising its own forward guidance.
- **Consensus Check:** While TSMC's guidance is public, the explicit and strong linkage to "continued strength in AI" and the magnitude of the upgrade (from mid-20% previously) might not be fully priced into NVIDIA's specific consensus estimates.

- **Impact:** High. This is a direct, forward-looking disclosure from NVIDIA's CEO, indicating a robust and expanding pipeline of AI products being developed with TSMC. This suggests sustained growth opportunities for NVIDIA well beyond current product cycles and is likely not fully incorporated into consensus.
- **Consensus Check:** This specific detail about "six additional AI products" is likely non-consensus as it's a very recent and specific disclosure from Jensen Huang, not general market knowledge.

Demand for the company's advanced chips remains robust, he said, and the company is endeavoring to "narrow the gap between the demand and the capacity.""

- **Impact:** Medium-High. This indicates that despite TSMC's efforts, demand for advanced chips (heavily driven by AI and NVIDIA) continues to outstrip supply. This suggests sustained pricing power for NVIDIA and a strong demand environment, even if it implies some capacity constraints.
- **Consensus Check:** While capacity constraints are generally known, the explicit statement from TSMC's CEO about actively "narrowing the gap" suggests an ongoing, significant imbalance that might not be fully appreciated in its implications for NVIDIA's sustained revenue and margin strength.

- **Impact:** High. CoWoS packaging is critical for NVIDIA's high-performance AI GPUs. NVIDIA securing a "majority share" of this rapidly expanding capacity underscores its strategic importance to TSMC and its ability to meet demand, potentially leading to higher-than-expected unit shipments and revenue.
- **Consensus Check:** While CoWoS capacity expansion is generally known, the specific detail of NVIDIA commanding a "majority share" and the timeline ("next 18 months") could be a non-consensus competitive advantage for NVIDIA.

- **Impact:** Medium. While the China export restrictions are known, the swift development of a Blackwell-based "China-compliant" chip (B30A) that "outperforms the H20" and the potential to monetize existing H20 inventory suggest a more effective and quicker mitigation of the China headwind than might be broadly anticipated. This could lead to a more positive FY2026 outlook for China revenue.
- **Consensus Check:** The specific details about the B30A being Blackwell-based and outperforming H20, combined with the potential for monetizing $10 billion of H20 inventory, could be non-consensus and provide a clearer path for NVIDIA's China strategy.
