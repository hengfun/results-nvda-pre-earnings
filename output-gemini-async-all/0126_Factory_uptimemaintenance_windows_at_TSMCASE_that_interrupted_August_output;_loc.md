## Analysis

As a pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the primary objective was to identify material, non-consensus information regarding factory uptime or maintenance windows at TSMC and ASE that may have interrupted August output. Based on a comprehensive review of web content published within the last three months, **no direct evidence of significant factory uptime or maintenance interruptions at TSMC or ASE that materially impacted August output was found.**

Instead, the prevailing sentiment and reported data point towards robust demand for advanced semiconductors, particularly those used in AI applications, leading to high utilization rates at key foundries like TSMC. While geopolitical shifts and IP theft allegations present long-term considerations, they do not appear to have caused immediate, reported disruptions to August production.

### Analysis of Findings:

The absence of reports detailing August production interruptions at TSMC or ASE is a key finding in itself. Given NVIDIA's reliance on these manufacturers for its advanced AI chips, any significant disruption would likely be widely reported and could negatively impact earnings or guidance. The available information, conversely, suggests a period of high demand and production.

TSMC's strong revenue performance in July 2025 and the "very tight" supply of its 3nm chips indicate that its fabs are operating at or near full capacity to meet the surging demand for AI-related components. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's recent visit to TSMC, explicitly to thank operations staff and discuss new chips already in fabs, further reinforces the notion of continuous, high-volume production.

The IP theft allegations, while serious, are related to 2nm technology and represent a potential future risk rather than an immediate disruption to August output. Similarly, ASE's Q2 2025 results and general outlook on tariffs do not point to specific August operational interruptions.

Therefore, for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report, the lack of reported production interruptions at its key suppliers in August suggests a stable supply chain environment, at least from an operational uptime perspective. The focus will likely remain on demand strength, pricing, and any forward-looking guidance related to geopolitical factors or the long-term implications of IP security.

### Structured Findings:

**1. Strong Demand Fuels TSMC's July Revenue Growth, Implying High Uptime**
*   **Snippet:** "TSMC's revenue in July 2025 jumped 22.5% quarter-over-quarter and 25.8% year-over-year, fueled by AI demand."
*   **Date:** August 17, 2025
*   **Source:** AInvest (https://www.ainvest.com/news/taiwan-raises-2025-growth-forecast-tariff-)
*   **Impact:** High - Strong revenue growth for TSMC directly benefits NVIDIA by indicating a robust supply of critical components. This data point for July, released in August, suggests no significant material interruptions leading into or during August.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known - The strong demand for AI and TSMC's performance are frequently discussed in the market.

**2. TSMC's 3nm Chip Supply Remains "Very Tight," Indicating Maximum Utilization**
*   **Snippet:** "TSMC last month said that the supply of its 3-nanometer chips was “very tight,” adding that it expected such constraints to last for a couple of years, due to a technology upgrade from 5-nanometer or 4-nanometer technology mostly used for AI chips."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025 (referring to TSMC's statement from "last month")
*   **Source:** Taipei Times
*   **Impact:** High - "Very tight" supply implies maximum utilization of TSMC's advanced manufacturing capacity, suggesting no significant downtime or interruptions in recent months, including August, for critical AI chip production.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known - Supply constraints for leading-edge nodes are a persistent theme in the semiconductor industry.

**3. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's Visit to TSMC Reinforces Ongoing Production and Partnership**
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) yesterday visited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電), as the chipmaker prepares for volume production of Nvidia's next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) chips. ... “All these new chips are now in TSMC's fab. I came to thank all of their operation's people working so hard for me,” Huang said."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025 (Huang's visit was "yesterday" from the article's publication date)
*   **Source:** Taipei Times
*   **Impact:** High - Direct confirmation from NVIDIA's CEO about new chips being in TSMC's fabs and his appreciation for the operations staff strongly suggests continuous, high-volume production without major interruptions impacting NVIDIA's supply.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known - High-profile visits by industry leaders are typically reported.

**4. TSMC Faces 2nm IP Theft Allegations, a Potential Future Risk**
*   **Snippet:** "The 2025 corporate espionage allegations against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have exposed a new dimension of risk: the fragility of intellectual property (IP) in an era of geopolitical rivalry. The alleged theft of TSMC's 2nm chip technology—a process critical to AI accelerators and high-performance computing—has not only shaken investor confidence but also forced a reevaluation of how capital is allocated in the global semiconductor ecosystem."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (original source likely a financial/tech news outlet)
*   **Impact:** Medium - While not directly impacting August output, IP theft of 2nm technology is material for future advanced chip production, which is crucial for NVIDIA's long-term roadmap. It represents a significant long-term risk to TSMC's technological leadership and potentially NVIDIA's future supply of cutting-edge chips.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked for *immediate* earnings impact, but the news of the allegations themselves might be known. The *implication* for August output is non-consensus.

**5. No Reported August Output Interruptions for ASE**
*   **Snippet:** (No direct snippet found across all search results indicating factory uptime/maintenance windows at ASE that interrupted August output.)
*   **Date:** N/A (Based on review of all search results within the last 3 months)
*   **Source:** N/A (Based on review of all search results)
*   **Impact:** Medium - The absence of negative news regarding ASE's August output, particularly given its crucial role in semiconductor packaging and testing, suggests no material disruptions that would impact NVIDIA's supply chain from this partner.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked - The absence of news is a key takeaway for a research analyst, indicating no reported issues.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
There are no direct contradictions regarding August output interruptions. The primary gap is the complete absence of any specific reports detailing factory uptime or maintenance windows that *interrupted* August output at either TSMC or ASE. All available information points to high demand and continuous production, especially for AI-related chips. This suggests that if any routine maintenance or minor issues occurred, they were either non-material or managed without impacting overall output significantly enough to warrant public reporting.
