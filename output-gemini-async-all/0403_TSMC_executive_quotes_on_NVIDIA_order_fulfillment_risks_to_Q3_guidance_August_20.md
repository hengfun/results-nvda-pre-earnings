## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, for the quarter ending July 2025. As a pre-earnings research analyst, the focus is on identifying material, non-consensus information from TSMC executives or reports concerning NVIDIA's order fulfillment risks to its Q3 guidance. Recent reports indicate that while NVIDIA has secured a significant portion of TSMC's advanced packaging capacity, TSMC continues to acknowledge bottlenecks in key technologies, which could impact NVIDIA's ability to meet surging demand, particularly for its next-generation AI chips. Geopolitical factors have also previously led to TSMC reallocating capacity, causing significant delays for NVIDIA's China-focused products.

Here are the key findings:

**Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "On the bottom line, TSMC's packaging capacity is a bottleneck; higher ASPs from advanced packaging services could drive margin expansion if the B30s use HBM... Simply because packaging is a supply-constrained segment. As you may already know, TSMC's CoWoS is the choke point for AI capacity, a topic discussed during the last Q&A, when management confirmed they are trying to narrow the gap in packaging with the current levels of demand: And so the megatrend for AI continues to be strong, and so is the CoWoS. And so now we are—again, we are in a mode trying to narrow the gap. Given that NVIDIA's Blackwell family uses CoWoS..."
    *   **Date:** August 27, 2025
    *   **Source:** Taiwan Semiconductor: Ultra Bullish On Nvidia's (Likely) B30/B30A To China
    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct acknowledgement from TSMC management (or a close paraphrase from an analyst report on their Q&A) that CoWoS packaging is a "choke point" and a "supply-constrained segment," directly impacting NVIDIA's Blackwell family of chips. This bottleneck could limit NVIDIA's ability to fully capitalize on demand, potentially affecting Q3 guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that CoWoS is tight, but specific confirmation from TSMC management on "narrowing the gap" and its direct link to Blackwell is a strong, recent affirmation that could be overlooked in its immediate implications for guidance.

*   **Snippet:** "During the earnings call, analysts inquired about TSMC's capacity constraints and strategic initiatives. The company acknowledged tight capacity for its N3 and N5 technologies, driven by strong demand in AI and HPC markets."
    *   **Date:** August 21, 2025
    *   **Source:** Earnings call transcript: TSMC sees 60.7% EPS growth in Q2 2025 - Investing.com
    *   **Impact:** Medium. TSMC's direct acknowledgement of "tight capacity" for N3 and N5 technologies, which are crucial for NVIDIA's advanced GPUs, indicates ongoing supply constraints. While not explicitly naming NVIDIA, it directly impacts their primary customer in the AI/HPC space. This could contribute to order fulfillment challenges.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Generally known that advanced node capacity is tight, but a direct statement from TSMC's earnings call just days before NVIDIA's report reinforces this and could be a subtle signal for NVIDIA's guidance.

*   **Snippet:** "The U.S. government's April ban on sales of the H20 chips had forced Nvidia to void customer orders and cancel manufacturing capacity it had booked at chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC)... TSMC had shifted its H20 production lines to produce other chips for other customers, and manufacturing new chips from scratch could take nine months, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at a media event in Beijing this week, according to the report."
    *   **Date:** July 19, 2025
    *   **Source:** Nvidia's China restart faces production obstacles, The Information reports
    *   **Impact:** High. This reveals a concrete instance of order fulfillment risk where geopolitical events led to TSMC reallocating NVIDIA's booked capacity. The nine-month lead time cited by CEO Jensen Huang to restart production for these chips highlights the significant delays and challenges NVIDIA faces in adapting to such disruptions, directly impacting revenue potential from the China market.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The H20 ban and its impact on China sales are known, but the specific detail about TSMC reallocating capacity and Jensen Huang's 9-month lead time for new production is a granular, material detail that might be overlooked in its full implications for Q3 and beyond.

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC's monthly CoWoS capacity is expected to effectively double to between 65,000 units to 75,000 units by the end of 2025 from 35,000 per month in 2024. Further expansion is expected to 100,000 monthly units come 2026. This added capacity will help Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and other chipmakers ramp up sales of their AI GPUs."

    *   **Impact:** High. This provides specific, forward-looking numbers on TSMC's CoWoS capacity expansion. While positive for future supply, the current "bottleneck" suggests that even with doubling capacity, demand might still outstrip supply in the near term, especially for Q3. The pace of this ramp-up and its immediate impact on NVIDIA's Q3 fulfillment will be critical.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The general idea of TSMC expanding CoWoS capacity is known, but these specific monthly unit targets and the timeline for doubling by year-end 2025 and further expansion into 2026 provide concrete data points that could be used to assess the realism of NVIDIA's Q3 guidance.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has secured more than 70% of TSMC's advanced chip packaging capacity for 2025, according to Taiwanese media reports. This move comes as rising artificial intelligence (AI) demand drives the need for cutting-edge semiconductor technology, particularly for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell AI chips."
    *   **Date:** February 23, 2025
    *   **Source:** Nvidia Locks in Over 70% of TSMC's Advanced Packaging Capacity for 2025
    *   **Impact:** Medium. While securing a large portion of capacity is positive, it also underscores the extreme tightness of TSMC's advanced packaging. Even with 70% secured, any unforeseen issues at TSMC or a further surge in demand beyond current projections could still lead to fulfillment risks for NVIDIA. This also highlights NVIDIA's heavy reliance on TSMC.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The fact that NVIDIA has secured significant capacity is likely known, but the sheer percentage (over 70%) and its implications for the remaining market, as well as the potential for demand to still outstrip even this secured allocation, could be a nuanced point.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** There are no direct contradictions in the provided snippets. The information consistently points to TSMC's CoWoS capacity being a bottleneck, even as TSMC works to expand it and NVIDIA secures a large portion.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   While TSMC acknowledges bottlenecks, there are no specific executive quotes *directly* stating a risk to NVIDIA's *Q3 guidance* due to these fulfillment issues. The impact is inferred from the general capacity constraints and past events.
    *   The exact utilization rate of NVIDIA's secured 70%+ capacity for Q3 is not specified.
    *   Details on the current status of H20 chip production and sales to China, and whether the 9-month restart period has been initiated or completed, are not fully clear from these snippets.
    *   The precise impact of TSMC's overseas fab expansions on overall capacity for NVIDIA's specific products is not detailed.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and Q3 guidance will be heavily scrutinized for any indications of supply chain constraints, particularly from its critical foundry partner, TSMC. Recent reports confirm that TSMC's advanced packaging, specifically its CoWoS technology, remains a "choke point" for AI chip production, a bottleneck directly acknowledged by TSMC management. This is highly material given NVIDIA's reliance on CoWoS for its next-generation Blackwell chips. While TSMC is actively working to "narrow the gap" and is projected to double its monthly CoWoS capacity by the end of 2025 and further expand in 2026, the immediate impact on Q3 fulfillment remains a key concern.

Adding to the complexity, past geopolitical events, such as the U.S. ban on H20 chip sales to China, forced NVIDIA to cancel booked manufacturing capacity at TSMC. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang indicated that restarting production for such chips could take nine months, as TSMC had reallocated those production lines. This highlights the vulnerability of NVIDIA's order fulfillment to external factors and TSMC's capacity management decisions. Although NVIDIA has reportedly secured over 70% of TSMC's advanced packaging capacity for 2025, the persistent "tight capacity" in N3 and N5 technologies suggests that demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs continues to push the limits of available supply. Investors will be closely watching NVIDIA's commentary on these supply chain dynamics and the ramp-up of Blackwell shipments, as any unexpected delays or constraints could temper an otherwise bullish outlook for Q3.
