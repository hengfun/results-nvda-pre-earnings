## Analysis

As a pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective is to identify material, non-consensus information regarding BESI/ASMPT/K&S order backlogs for CoWoS/die-attach tools destined for ASE/Amkor, and their lead times to install, with a strict focus on web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025).

The research indicates a continued severe bottleneck in CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, with NVIDIA maintaining a highly preferential position. While explicit, recent (within 3 months) quantitative data on specific order backlogs for BESI, ASMPT, and K&S tools for ASE/Amkor, or precise installation lead times, remains elusive in public domain searches, the qualitative information strongly suggests sustained high demand and strategic importance of these suppliers. ASMPT, in particular, appears to be a critical enabler due to its dominance in Thermocompression Bonding (TCB) technology, essential for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) integration in CoWoS. A recent strategic manufacturing optimization by ASMPT could introduce short-term dynamics.

**Key Findings and Analysis:**

1.  **NVIDIA's Dominant CoWoS Allocation:** NVIDIA continues to secure the majority of TSMC's limited CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, which is expected to roughly double in 2025 and expand further in 2026. This preferential access is a critical enabler for NVIDIA's ability to meet the surging demand for its AI GPUs, potentially leaving competitors at a disadvantage. This reinforces NVIDIA's strong supply chain leverage.

2.  **ASMPT's Critical Role in TCB Technology:** ASMPT's dominance in Thermocompression Bonding (TCB) technology positions it as a "kingmaker" in the advanced packaging sector, driven by AI and hyperscale data center demand. TCB is crucial for integrating HBM with logic dies in CoWoS structures. This suggests that ASMPT's capacity and lead times for these specialized tools are highly material to the overall CoWoS supply chain, and by extension, to NVIDIA's production capabilities.

3.  **ASMPT's Strategic Manufacturing Optimization:** ASMPT announced the closure of its Shenzhen equipment manufacturing facility, affecting approximately 950 staff, as part of a strategic optimization to improve cost competitiveness, agility, and resilience. While intended for long-term benefits, such a significant operational change in its Semiconductor Solutions Segment could introduce short-term adjustments or shifts in production, potentially impacting lead times for certain advanced packaging tools.

4.  **Overall Die Attach Equipment Market Growth:** The broader die attach equipment market, which includes tools from BESI, ASMPT, and K&S, is projected to grow significantly. The market is expected to reach USD 1.54 billion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 6.09% to USD 2.07 billion by 2030. This growth is explicitly linked to the thriving AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) sectors, driving demand for high-speed and high-precision die bonders.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found within the specified three-month publication window.
*   **Gaps:** A significant gap exists in finding explicit, recent (within the last 3 months) quantitative data on specific order backlogs for BESI, ASMPT, and K&S's CoWoS/die-attach tools specifically for ASE/Amkor. Similarly, precise lead times for the installation of these tools for these OSATs are not readily available in the recent public domain. The information is more focused on overall market trends and strategic importance rather than granular operational metrics.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Upstream, the bottlenecks are even more decisive. Advanced packaging capacity for CoWoS at Taiwan Semiconductor is limited, even with output expected to roughly double in 2025 and expand again in 2026. Industry reports indicate that Nvidia has secured the majority of that allocation, leaving rivals with less room to ship at scale."

    *   **Impact:** High. This directly addresses the critical CoWoS bottleneck and NVIDIA's privileged access to capacity, which is fundamental to its ability to meet demand for AI GPUs and impacts its revenue and forward guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While the CoWoS bottleneck and NVIDIA's large demand are known, the explicit statement of NVIDIA securing the "majority of that allocation" is a strong, potentially non-consensus detail that highlights NVIDIA's competitive advantage.

*   **Snippet:** "Singapore-based ASMPT... With AI and hyperscale data centers driving a new wave of demand for advanced packaging, ASMPT's dominance in thermo-compression bonding (TCB) technology places it at the center of the industry's next inflection point."

    *   **Impact:** High. TCB is a crucial technology for HBM integration in CoWoS. ASMPT's "dominance" implies significant leverage and potential for sustained strong order volumes and extended lead times for its equipment, directly impacting the broader CoWoS supply chain and NVIDIA's ability to scale.
    *   **Consensus Check:** ASMPT's role in advanced packaging is recognized, but the characterization of its "dominance" in TCB and its position as a "kingmaker" could be a stronger, more non-consensus view of its strategic importance and potential impact on supply.

*   **Snippet:** "ASMPT has decided to close ASMPT Equipment (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. ... This facility is part of the company's Semiconductor Solutions Segment, and the closure affects approximately 950 staff. This was a tough but necessary decision to optimise ASMPT's global supply chain to better align it with evolving market dynamics and customer needs. It is expected to improve the cost competitiveness, agility and resilience of ASMPT's global manufacturing operations for its key products and solutions."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While framed as an optimization, the closure of a significant manufacturing facility could lead to short-term disruptions or shifts in production for ASMPT's Semiconductor Solutions Segment, potentially affecting lead times for advanced packaging equipment. This could be a minor headwind or a signal of strategic realignment that might affect future supply dynamics.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is a direct company announcement and thus public information. However, the market's full assessment of its short-term impact on specific advanced packaging tool availability and lead times for key customers (like NVIDIA via OSATs) might be overlooked or underestimated.

*   **Snippet:** "The Die Attach Equipment Market is expected to reach USD 1.54 billion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 6.09% to reach USD 2.07 billion by 2030. Palomar Technologies, Inc., Shinkawa Ltd., MicroAssembly Technologies, Ltd., ASM Pacific Technology Limited and Be Semiconductor Industries N.V. are the major companies operating in this market."

    *   **Impact:** Low-Medium. This provides a quantitative outlook for the overall die attach equipment market, confirming robust growth driven by semiconductor demand and listing key players (including BESI and ASMPT). While not specific to CoWoS/ASE/Amkor backlogs, it underpins the strong demand environment for the tools these suppliers provide.
    *   **Consensus Check:** General market growth for semiconductor equipment is widely known. The specific market size and CAGR for die attach equipment might offer more detailed insights than common consensus, but its direct impact on NVIDIA's immediate earnings is indirect.

*   **Snippet:** "AI & HPC Thriving: More orders for AI and high-performance computing chips result in the funding of advanced semiconductor packaging solutions, which demand high-speed and high-precision die bonders. ... Key companies are ASM Pacific Technology, Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Besi (BE Semiconductor Industries), and Shinkawa Ltd."
