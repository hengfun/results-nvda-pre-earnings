## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective was to find material, non-consensus information regarding warranty accrual increases at OEMs with a heavy NVIDIA mix, published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025).

Direct evidence of "warranty accrual increases at OEMs with heavy NVDA mix" within the specified timeframe was not explicitly found in the search results. This type of granular financial data from OEMs, specifically tied to a single component supplier like NVIDIA and publicly disclosed within a short window, is often proprietary or not immediately available through general web searches.

However, one relevant finding from a recent publication indirectly points to potential cost pressures related to NVIDIA's high-end GPUs and their reliability/replacement challenges. This could be a proxy for increased warranty-related expenses for OEMs.

**Structured Findings:**

**Finding 1:** High Cost of GPU Replacements and Challenges with H100 Replacements

*   **Snippet:** "Extended Warranties: Worth the Cost? Absolutely—especially when running H200s in production. You can lock in coverage for GPUs that cost ~$20K–$25K each. A 5-year extended plan that includes GPU replacement, remote diagnostics, and on-site servicing can prevent $100K+ in unexpected expenses." and "Tip: Some vendors offer extended warranties with rapid replacement guarantees for H200s, but not for H100s due to global inventory constraints." and "Reminder: GPU replacements are a major cost driver. Replacing a failed H100 post-warranty? ~$30,000."
*   **Date:** June 27, 2025
*   **Source:** Uvation, "Avoiding Budget Overruns: Costs of AI Server Deployments"
*   **Impact:** **Medium-High**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This information, published within the last three months, highlights that GPU replacements are a "major cost driver" for AI server deployments, with a single H100 replacement costing approximately $30,000 post-warranty. The explicit mention that "some vendors offer extended warranties with rapid replacement guarantees for H200s, but not for H100s due to global inventory constraints" is particularly material. This suggests either a higher-than-anticipated failure rate for H100s, or simply an extreme scarcity of replacement units, making it difficult for vendors (OEMs) to fulfill rapid replacement guarantees. Both scenarios would lead to increased costs for OEMs (either directly through higher warranty claims or indirectly through customer dissatisfaction and potential penalties for failing to meet SLAs) and could impact their profitability and, by extension, their demand for NVIDIA's products if reliability or serviceability becomes a significant concern. The high cost of these GPUs means even a small increase in failure rates or replacement difficulties can have a substantial financial impact.
*   **Consensus Check:** **Overlooked.** While the high cost of H100/H200 GPUs is widely known, the specific detail about the *lack of rapid replacement guarantees for H100s due to global inventory constraints* and GPU replacements being a "major cost driver" is likely not widely factored into consensus earnings models for NVIDIA. This points to potential operational challenges for OEMs and end-users that could indirectly affect NVIDIA's sales or reputation if not addressed.

**Analysis of Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding increased warranty accruals. The information found is more of an indirect signal rather than a direct counter-narrative.
*   **Gaps:** The primary gap is the absence of explicit, recent financial disclosures from major OEMs (like Dell, HP, Lenovo, or server manufacturers such as Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron) detailing *increases* in their warranty accruals specifically attributed to NVIDIA components. The search results provided general NVIDIA warranty terms, older analyses of NVIDIA's own warranty expenses, and anecdotal user experiences, but not the specific OEM financial data requested. This could be due to the proprietary nature of such information or simply that no such significant, publicly reported increases have occurred within the narrow three-month window.

**Conclusion:**

While direct evidence of increased warranty accruals at OEMs tied to NVIDIA components within the last three months remains elusive, the Uvation article from June 2025 provides a valuable, non-consensus insight. The high cost of GPU replacements, coupled with the inability of some vendors to offer rapid replacement guarantees for H100s due to "global inventory constraints," suggests potential underlying reliability or supply chain challenges that could translate into higher warranty-related costs for OEMs. This could indirectly impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings or forward-looking guidance if these issues are more widespread or severe than currently perceived by the market. Analysts should consider probing into the actual failure rates and replacement logistics for high-end NVIDIA data center GPUs when evaluating OEM sentiment and potential future demand.
