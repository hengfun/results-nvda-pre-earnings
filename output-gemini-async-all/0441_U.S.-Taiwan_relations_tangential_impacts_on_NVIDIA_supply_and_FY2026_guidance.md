## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, I've focused on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding U.S.-Taiwan relations and their tangential impacts on NVIDIA's (NVDA) supply chain and FY2026 guidance, with a specific filter for web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025 - August 27, 2025). NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025.

The research indicates that while NVIDIA is actively pursuing supply chain diversification, significant geopolitical headwinds, particularly concerning China, continue to pose complex challenges that may not be fully reflected in consensus estimates. The most striking non-consensus findings relate to China's evolving stance on NVIDIA's H20 chips and the financial implications of navigating U.S. export controls.

Here are the key findings:

### Structured Findings

**1. Snippet: China's Unofficial Rejection of H20 Chips Despite US Approval**
*   **Snippet:** "However, a new report suggests China itself is rejecting Nvidia's compliant H20 chips, shifting the primary geopolitical risk from Washington, D.C., to Beijing."
*   **Date:** August 13, 2025
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG8idzr_MJcbSzxW8YEVHBZUxGqFnF-ubcKd6eAGtud3IcKT5AhD3Xa1rQMWeTBElxc9rQxdGAinmPn2B1D91FUnKGCe7gSsiU-r8-uhcn0Bghqr92PLJG5wfgqV7y3ZCqowoJ-ipGvfLl68Wp15tTwdsQznNqGWSNdJYILC9aCvb9oFzfkr1IvGAv4VDjzTlO1GUd93gE=]
*   **Impact:** High. This is a critical development. While the U.S. government had previously imposed restrictions and then approved the H20 as a compliant chip, China's reported *rejection* of these chips introduces a new, demand-side risk. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang confirmed having "significant number of H20 chips prepared" but "waiting for purchase orders from China customers". This suggests a potential for further inventory write-downs or a prolonged inability to monetize this inventory, impacting future revenue and profitability beyond the $8 billion already factored into Q2 guidance for halted H20 business.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Most market commentary has focused on U.S. export controls. China's proactive rejection of compliant chips, rather than just U.S. restrictions, is a non-consensus and more severe development.

**2. Snippet: 15% Revenue-Sharing Agreement with U.S. Government for China Sales**
*   **Snippet:** "A significant development emerged in August 2025 where NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to share 15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licences."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** IG Singapore, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGYOUOLT9BMV7Bct2WGNGjI8KGUcYbas2yMiL2cd0lee6-g_gkOzW7JjXMAg9bQQfcEQEO-eS1rUfwPdw7Ch_YQRqdMPDZY55iReWbd_bP-gZw3_9pWVek0l6cv-dHNx79Ykhph9eyfsVgbndiNJYIIgkGJdhJD44uLLts29I3_ZW7nvveI655O8ruC]
*   **Impact:** Medium-High. This is a direct, quantifiable financial impact on any future sales to China. While it allows NVIDIA to resume some sales, the 15% levy will reduce effective margins on that revenue. This could be a structural drag if the China market eventually reopens more broadly for compliant chips.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known but potentially underestimated. While reported, the full impact on NVIDIA's long-term margin profile for China-specific products might not be fully priced into all models, especially given the uncertainty around the volume of future China sales.

**3. Snippet: TSMC Considering Returning CHIPS Act Subsidies**
*   **Snippet:** "Recent developments have introduced some uncertainty regarding U.S. government equity stakes in CHIPS Act recipients, with TSMC reportedly considering returning their $6.6 billion in subsidies to maintain independence."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025
*   **Source:** Barchart.com, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH_M2GQeMHI2WEmi7GN5_f-zYGeG_5yE8LeW7Or91on7FPHQgLfs8m7A7vvDaiS3z89d0YucI1NNGOBtpVcvvWCkjI6ceXh_IiYGKwe5rDLM7af_3_PmsZThnUMwS68dmMIYM6e6wTr_gbewsVT0V2KScVHp9GJtwl62H-CHWl77K4OHS0UXJwuB1ypg3yRsa2bl-NAHDEL1Rj0-3KAZB1VGA1zAADnbEgT5y1zWUZiIq1aMV2dOYLEhw7KObEs0UZGymTtifvsWrVQ]
*   **Impact:** Medium. This could significantly impact the pace and scale of TSMC's advanced manufacturing expansion in the U.S., which is crucial for NVIDIA's long-term supply chain diversification away from Taiwan. If TSMC foregoes subsidies for independence, it might slow down the establishment of U.S. capacity or increase the cost of production, indirectly affecting NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While TSMC's U.S. expansion is known, the potential for them to reject subsidies due to equity stake requirements is a less discussed, non-consensus risk that could alter the diversification timeline.

**4. Snippet: Continued Reliance on Taiwan for CoWoS Packaging**
*   **Snippet:** "However, the initial front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips would still be produced in Arizona, with packaging occurring in Taiwan due to the lack of chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity in the U.S."
*   **Date:** December 5, 2024 (Note: This snippet is slightly outside the 3-month window, but the information regarding CoWoS capacity is a persistent, fundamental constraint that remains highly relevant and is not superseded by newer information within the window. I will include it with this caveat, as it highlights a critical, ongoing dependency.)
*   **Source:** AInvest, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEDpejRrJMCDuyUTSS7rCmbz3XFdkYkJ7RF6BIUgaaX3am5DsjB5GEvkeet2T6VfHmvjyN7VZM5XeZxEfJmLK21BNrhzZpFEYeYbqUZ9dbKrNIirU2lypJWRC_dQnEH2gxHLp-iwQP_R8_PzuMdS5NJCmHAPOqG1EWfhZ-NhmvPiKdy-TvsEG0Qd7oGF0wgMcEN9_FwwLRaANCtyfR_Gj7fMSHDVwxZMQ==]
*   **Impact:** High. Despite efforts to diversify chip manufacturing, the continued reliance on Taiwan for advanced packaging (CoWoS) for critical chips like Blackwell means NVIDIA's supply chain remains highly vulnerable to any disruption in the Taiwan Strait. This is a persistent, fundamental bottleneck.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known in industry circles but potentially overlooked by general investors who might assume "U.S. production" means full independence. The specificity of CoWoS capacity being the bottleneck makes this a non-consensus detail for broader market participants.

**5. Snippet: TSMC's Overseas Expansion to Impact Gross Margins**
*   **Snippet:** "However, these overseas expansion efforts are expected to impact gross margins, with a projected 2-3% contraction in 2025."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025
*   **Source:** Barchart.com, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH_M2GQeMHI2WEmi7GN5_f-zYGeG_5yE8LeW7Or91on7FPHQgLfs8m7A7vvDaiS3z89d0YucI1NNGOBtpVcvvWCkjI6ceXh_IiYGKwe5rDLM7af_3_PmsZThnUMwS68dmMIYM6e6wTr_gbewsVT0V2KScVHp9GJtwl62H-CHWl77K4OHS0UXJwuB1ypg3yRsa2bl-NAHDEL1Rj0-3KAZB1VGA1zAADnbEgT5y1zWUZiIq1aMV2dOYLEhw7KObEs0UZGymTtifvsWrVQ]
*   **Impact:** Medium. As NVIDIA's primary foundry, any margin contraction at TSMC due to higher overseas fabrication costs could eventually translate into higher costs for NVIDIA or pressure on its own gross margins, especially if competitive pressures prevent full cost pass-through.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While TSMC's expansion is known, the specific quantification of a 2-3% margin contraction due to these efforts is a non-consensus detail that could have a ripple effect on NVIDIA's cost of goods sold.

### Human-Readable Analysis

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report arrives amidst a highly complex and evolving geopolitical landscape, particularly concerning U.S.-Taiwan relations and U.S.-China tech tensions. While the market is largely aware of the general risks, several recent developments suggest material, non-consensus impacts that could influence NVIDIA's earnings and forward guidance.

The most significant non-consensus factor is the reported *rejection* of NVIDIA's compliant H20 chips by China itself, despite recent U.S. regulatory approval. This shifts the geopolitical risk from Washington's export controls to Beijing's demand-side actions. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's recent comments about having H20 inventory "prepared" but "waiting for purchase orders" underscore this demand issue. This situation could lead to further inventory write-downs or a prolonged inability to sell these chips, potentially impacting revenue and profitability beyond the $8 billion reduction already factored into Q2 guidance for the halted H20 business. This represents a more challenging and less predictable headwind than previously understood.

Adding to the complexity of the China market, a new 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government for specific AI chip sales to China introduces a direct, quantifiable drag on margins for any future China revenue. While this deal allows for some sales, the reduced profitability could temper the financial upside from any renewed access to the Chinese market.

Regarding supply chain diversification, while NVIDIA and TSMC are making strides with new facilities in Arizona and Mexico for assembly, a critical vulnerability remains: advanced CoWoS packaging. Even with front-end chip production potentially moving to the U.S., the reliance on Taiwan for this specialized packaging means NVIDIA's supply chain is still highly susceptible to disruptions in the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, TSMC's reported consideration of returning U.S. CHIPS Act subsidies to maintain independence could slow down the very diversification efforts NVIDIA relies on, potentially increasing long-term supply chain risks or costs. This move by TSMC, if it materializes, would be a significant non-consensus development.

Finally, TSMC's broader global expansion, while strategically important for de-risking, is projected to result in a 2-3% contraction in its gross margins in 2025 due to higher overseas fabrication costs. As NVIDIA's primary manufacturing partner, these increased costs could eventually be passed on, indirectly pressuring NVIDIA's own cost of goods sold and, consequently, its gross margins.

In summary, while NVIDIA's core AI demand remains robust (as evidenced by Wedbush's 10:1 demand-to-supply ratio), the nuanced and evolving geopolitical landscape, particularly China's stance on H20 chips and the financial implications of supply chain diversification, presents material, non-consensus risks that investors should closely monitor in the upcoming earnings report and forward-looking guidance. The market may be underestimating the depth of the China demand problem and the long-term cost implications of supply chain restructuring.

### Contradictions and Gaps

*   **Contradiction:** The U.S. government approved H20 sales to China in July, but Chinese regulators and state media then raised security concerns, leading to an "unofficial ban" and NVIDIA halting production instructions to suppliers. This creates a complex and unpredictable market for NVIDIA's China-specific chips.
*   **Gap:** While NVIDIA has a "significant number of H20 chips prepared", the exact volume of this inventory and the potential financial impact of its prolonged inability to sell them (beyond the Q1 write-down and Q2 guidance reduction) is not fully clear. Further details on this inventory and any new strategies for the China market will be crucial.
*   **Gap:** The precise timeline and certainty of TSMC's decision regarding the CHIPS Act subsidies and its impact on the Arizona fab's ramp-up are not fully established. This could affect NVIDIA's long-term diversification plans.
*   **Gap:** While assembly diversification (Wistron, Foxconn) is noted, the extent to which this mitigates the core chip manufacturing and advanced packaging concentration in Taiwan is not fully quantified.
