## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply and demand is likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The information is filtered to content published within the last three months.

***

### Analysis of Key Findings:

The HBM market remains incredibly tight, with strong demand from AI accelerators continuing to outpace supply. SK Hynix and Micron are in strong positions, having largely pre-sold their 2025 HBM capacity, and are actively ramping up production of HBM3e and developing HBM4. Samsung, while a major player, appears to be facing challenges in qualifying its HBM3e for NVIDIA's current generation, potentially impacting NVIDIA's ability to fully diversify its HBM supply in the near term. The emergence of hyperscalers designing their own AI ASICs is also diversifying HBM demand, which could further strain the overall market and influence NVIDIA's long-term supply strategies. The transition to more advanced HBM (12-Hi HBM3e and HBM4) presents yield challenges for all suppliers, which could lead to continued supply constraints and higher prices.
