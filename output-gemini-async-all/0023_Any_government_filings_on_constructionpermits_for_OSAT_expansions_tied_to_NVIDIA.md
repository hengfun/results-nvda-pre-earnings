## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding OSAT expansions and packaging strategies has been identified within the last three months, likely to impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's supply chain for advanced packaging is undergoing significant shifts, driven by both geopolitical factors and the relentless demand for AI chips. A critical, recent development is the reported halt in production for NVIDIA's H20 AI chip, designed for the Chinese market. This move, if confirmed and sustained, could directly impact NVIDIA's revenue from China and its associated supply chain partners like Amkor Technology and Samsung. This situation highlights the volatile nature of the US-China tech rivalry and its immediate effect on NVIDIA's product availability and sales in a key market.

Concurrently, to address the persistent bottleneck in TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, NVIDIA is reportedly accelerating its adoption of panel-level fan-out packaging (FOPLP) for its upcoming GB200 chips, moving the timeline from 2026 to 2025. This strategic pivot is creating new opportunities for Taiwanese OSAT providers like Powertech Technology (PTI) and AU Optronics, with PTI dedicating a significant portion of its capacity to FOPLP and Innolux's FOPLP lines already fully booked for Q3 2025. This shift could alleviate some packaging constraints and diversify NVIDIA's advanced packaging supply chain, but the speed and scale of this transition will be crucial.

Furthermore, major Taiwanese OSATs like ASE Technology are significantly increasing their capital expenditure and are expected to take on a larger share of TSMC's outsourced CoWoS-S packaging. ASE is projected to handle 40-50% of TSMC's outsourced CoWoS-S by 2025, indicating a deepening reliance on these partners to meet the surging demand for NVIDIA's AI chips. While this suggests robust business for OSATs, it also underscores the ongoing challenges in scaling advanced packaging capacity to match NVIDIA's growth trajectory.

These developments collectively point to a dynamic and somewhat uncertain supply chain environment. While the acceleration into FOPLP could be a positive long-term solution, the immediate impact of the H20 production halt and the ongoing CoWoS capacity crunch present both risks and opportunities that could influence NVIDIA's near-term performance and future guidance.

### Structured Findings:

**Finding 1: NVIDIA Halts H20 AI Chip Production for China Market**

*   **Snippet:** "On Aug. 21 (local time), The Information reported that Nvidia has instructed Samsung Electronics and Amkor to halt production related to H20. Samsung Electronics supplies high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for H20. Amkor, a U.S. semiconductor packaging company formerly known as Anam Semiconductor, combines the semi-finished H20 chipsets made by TSMC with components like HBM. While Samsung Electronics and Amkor have not confirmed the production halt, if true, it signals that Nvidia has suspended additional production of H20."

*   **Impact:** High (95) - This is highly material as it directly impacts NVIDIA's revenue stream from the crucial Chinese market. A production halt means a reduction in available chips for sale, potentially leading to a revenue shortfall or lower guidance for the region. It also signals significant geopolitical risk and supply chain disruption.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Emerging - While reported by "The Information" and picked up by Businesskorea and Reuters, the full implications and confirmation from NVIDIA or its partners are still unfolding. It's very recent news, making it non-consensus for the broader market.

**Finding 2: NVIDIA Accelerates GB200 to Panel-Level Fan-Out Packaging (FOPLP); PTI and Innolux Capacity Expansion**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA is reportedly planning to accelerate the introduction of its GB200, into panel-level fan-out packaging. According to a report from Economic Daily News, originally scheduled for 2026, this shift has been moved up to 2025, sparking opportunities in the panel-level fan-out packaging sector. Taiwanese companies like Powertech Technology Inc. (PTI) and AU Optronics (AUO) are said to have prepared with the necessary capabilities, expected to seize this market opportunity. ... PTI has fully dedicated its Hsinchu Plant 3 to panel-level fan-out packaging and TSV CIS (CMOS image sensors) technologies... The first phase capacity of its fan-out panel-level packaging (FOPLP) production line has already been fully booked, with mass production and shipments scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year."

*   **Impact:** High (85) - This represents a significant strategic shift for NVIDIA to diversify its advanced packaging solutions beyond CoWoS and address capacity constraints. The acceleration of GB200 to FOPLP in 2025, coupled with specific OSATs like PTI and Innolux having booked capacity, indicates new supply chain dynamics and potential for increased chip shipments.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Emerging - While the CoWoS bottleneck is known, the specific acceleration of GB200 to FOPLP and the detailed involvement of PTI and Innolux with fully booked capacity for Q3 2025 is likely not fully priced into the market.

**Finding 3: ASE Technology to Handle 40-50% of TSMC's Outsourced CoWoS-S Packaging by 2025**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia along accounts for ~70% of TSMC's CoWoS-L capacity in 2025. To keep up with demand, TSMC has chosen to outsource some of its packaging work. Some of the CoWoS orders, particularly in the mid- to low-tier CoWoS-S orders, are given to partners like Siliconware (SPIL) (owned by ASE) and ASE. Industry sources quoted by CNA reveal that ASE group and SPIL are working with TSMC on the back-end CoWoS-S oS (on-Substrate) process. By 2025, ASE may handle 40-50% of TSMC's outsourced CoWoS-S packaging."

*   **Impact:** Medium (70) - This provides a quantitative insight into the outsourcing of advanced packaging, indicating a significant reliance on ASE/SPIL for CoWoS-S. This suggests that while TSMC remains central, OSAT partners are playing an increasingly critical role in alleviating the CoWoS bottleneck for NVIDIA. This could lead to higher revenue for ASE and potentially smoother supply for NVIDIA, though the overall CoWoS bottleneck remains.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but specific percentage is less common - The general idea of TSMC outsourcing CoWoS is known, but the specific percentage (40-50%) that ASE is expected to handle by 2025 is a more granular detail that might not be fully appreciated by the broader market.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **H20 Production Halt Confirmation:** While reported by reputable sources, an official confirmation from NVIDIA or its direct partners (Samsung, Amkor) regarding the H20 production halt is still pending. The duration and full impact of this halt are also unclear. NVIDIA's spokesperson stated, "We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions," which is a general statement and not a direct confirmation or denial.
*   **FOPLP Scale and Ramp-up:** While the shift to FOPLP for GB200 is noted, the exact scale of this transition and how quickly it can ramp up to significantly alleviate CoWoS constraints remains to be seen. The capacity of PTI's Hsinchu Plant 3 and Innolux's fully booked lines are positive indicators, but the overall impact on NVIDIA's total packaging needs requires more detailed information.
*   **Geographical Focus:** The query specifically asked for Taiwan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. While Taiwan is heavily featured, specific government filings or BOI notices for construction/permits in Malaysia or the Philippines directly tied to NVIDIA's OSAT expansions within the last 3 months were not explicitly found in the search results. The US expansion is a prominent theme, but the user's focus was on Asia. This indicates a potential gap in the available public information for those specific regions and types of filings within the strict timeframe.
