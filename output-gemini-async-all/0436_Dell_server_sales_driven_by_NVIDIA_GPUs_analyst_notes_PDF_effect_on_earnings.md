## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding Dell server sales driven by NVIDIA GPUs has been extracted. This information is likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance, which is due after market close today, August 27, 2025.

### Analysis Summary

The overarching theme from recent reports is the "unprecedented demand" for Dell's AI-optimized servers, which are overwhelmingly powered by NVIDIA GPUs. This strong demand has translated into substantial order backlogs for Dell, with specific figures indicating a significant revenue stream for NVIDIA through this key partnership. While the general strength of AI server demand is widely acknowledged, the explicit and repeated emphasis on Dell's backlog being "primarily Nvidia-based" and the detailed financial figures from Dell's recent performance (or outlook) provide concrete, material data points for NVIDIA's upcoming report.

A particularly non-consensus and potentially impactful piece of information relates to geopolitical tensions, with reports of "trackers on servers" containing NVIDIA chips from Dell and Super Micro during shipment. This could introduce unforeseen supply chain complexities or geopolitical risks that might not be fully priced into NVIDIA's current outlook.

The ramp-up of NVIDIA's Blackwell platform and the improving supply of H200 GPUs are also critical, as they directly address NVIDIA's ability to meet the surging demand from partners like Dell. Dell's strategic focus on "sovereign AI" and its partnerships for integrated AI solutions further solidify the long-term demand for NVIDIA's technology.

However, it's important to note that while demand is high, Dell has indicated margin pressures due to the high cost of NVIDIA's GPUs, which could be a nuanced point for NVIDIA's own gross margin discussions.

### Structured Findings
