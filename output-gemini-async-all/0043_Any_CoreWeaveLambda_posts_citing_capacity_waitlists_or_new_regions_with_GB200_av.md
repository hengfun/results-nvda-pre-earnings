## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding CoreWeave and Lambda's NVIDIA GB200/GB300 deployments and capacity has been extracted from recent web content. This information is likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance, particularly concerning demand for its next-generation Blackwell platform.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The research indicates robust and accelerating demand for NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPUs (GB200 and GB300) through key cloud partners CoreWeave and Lambda. Both companies are aggressively deploying these advanced systems and expanding their data center footprints. CoreWeave, in particular, highlights its "first-to-market" status with both GB200 and GB300, suggesting a strong, perhaps preferential, relationship with NVIDIA for early access and deployment. The sheer scale of CoreWeave's reported revenue backlog, including a significant expansion deal with OpenAI, underscores the immense demand for NVIDIA's high-end AI accelerators.

Lambda, while also rapidly deploying Blackwell systems and building "gigawatt-scale AI factories," has explicitly stated that its GH200 (Grace Hopper) fleet is "completely sold out," which serves as a strong proxy for the intense demand for NVIDIA's top-tier chips. Furthermore, Lambda's securing of a substantial loan specifically to acquire H200 and Blackwell series chips highlights the capital intensity and urgency in securing supply.

A notable, potentially non-consensus point, is a report citing "reliability problems" with large-scale GB200 NVL72 training due to NVLink copper backplane faults and lagging diagnostic tools. If these issues are more widespread than currently acknowledged, they could present a near-term challenge for NVIDIA in scaling deployments and ensuring customer satisfaction, potentially impacting the pace of revenue recognition for these advanced systems. However, the overwhelming narrative from both partners is one of rapid deployment and high performance.
