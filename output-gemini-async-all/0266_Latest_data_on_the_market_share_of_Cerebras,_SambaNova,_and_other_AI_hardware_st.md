However, the forward-looking guidance could be impacted by these emerging trends.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report will be scrutinized not only for its continued growth but also for any signs of competitive erosion, particularly from specialized AI hardware startups like Cerebras and SambaNova Systems. While NVIDIA remains the undisputed leader in the AI GPU market, holding an estimated 80-90% share, the landscape is becoming increasingly dynamic.

Cerebras, known for its wafer-scale engine, is demonstrating significant performance advantages in specific high-end AI tasks, particularly in power efficiency for large language model inference. Its CS-3 processor claims to offer 2.2x less power consumption per unit of performance compared to NVIDIA's B200 for LLaMA 3.1 models. However, Cerebras faces a notable customer concentration risk, with over 85% of its 2024 revenue tied to a single partner, G42. The company is planning an IPO in 2025, which could provide capital for broader market penetration but also expose it to public market scrutiny.

SambaNova Systems is also emerging as a strong contender, focusing on AI inference with its specialized Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) processor. The company claims its SambaNova Cloud can outperform GPUs by 3x in speed and 5x in power efficiency for large-scale workloads like DeepSeek-R1 671B. More strikingly, SambaNova's CEO claims their system can run a 671 billion parameter model four times faster using one rack and 10 kilowatts, compared to 40 racks and 100 kilowatts for NVIDIA systems. These "orders of magnitude" differences in efficiency could be a powerful draw for enterprises looking to optimize their AI infrastructure costs.

A significant non-consensus projection suggests a potential 5% decline in NVIDIA's market share by late 2025, equating to a possible $10 billion revenue reduction, as businesses diversify their AI hardware investments. This indicates that while NVIDIA's dominance is currently strong, the competitive pressures from these specialized startups, particularly in the rapidly growing inference segment, are becoming more material. Investors will be keen to see if NVIDIA's Q2 earnings call addresses these emerging competitive threats and how the company plans to maintain its market leadership amidst a diversifying AI hardware ecosystem.
