## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information regarding liquid-cooling integrators and their signals on availability/backlogs for NVIDIA racks, based on recent web content.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The demand for liquid cooling solutions for NVIDIA's high-performance AI racks, particularly those based on the Blackwell architecture, remains exceptionally strong. This is a widely recognized trend, driven by the increasing power density and heat generation of advanced GPUs. Key integrators like Supermicro and Dell are actively expanding their liquid-cooled offerings and reporting significant backlogs, indicating robust demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure.

However, a notable non-consensus point emerges from Asetek, a prominent liquid cooling provider. While the company saw a sequential increase in its liquid cooling revenue from Q1 to Q2 2025, its Q2 2025 liquid cooling revenue experienced a year-over-year decline. This contrasts with the broader narrative of surging demand across the liquid cooling sector for AI. Asetek attributes its overall revenue impact to tariff situations and is "positioning the liquid cooling business for growth from '26 and beyond," emphasizing a renewed focus on "quality supply chain and full service" over solely low cost. Furthermore, Asetek has received "indications of interest" regarding potential strategic transactions involving its Liquid Cooling business, which could significantly alter the competitive landscape.

CoolIT Systems, another major player, demonstrated its innovation by launching a prototype single-phase liquid cooling cold plate in March 2025 capable of handling approximately 4,000 watts, significantly exceeding the cooling capacity for current-gen NVIDIA GPUs. This suggests that while demand is high, integrators are also pushing technological boundaries to meet future NVIDIA requirements.

Overall, while the market is clearly shifting towards liquid cooling for NVIDIA's AI solutions, Asetek's specific revenue performance and strategic considerations present a nuanced view that could be overlooked by the broader market. The emphasis on quality and full service over low cost by Asetek, coupled with Supermicro's readiness for volume shipments of DLC-2 systems, suggests a maturing market where reliability and comprehensive solutions are becoming as critical as raw capacity.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "Asetek, a leader in liquid cooling solutions with a market capitalization of $34.81 million, reported a decline in revenue for Q2 2025, with sales falling to $11.2 million from $12.7 million the previous year. Despite the downturn, the company maintained a steady gross margin and reduced operating expenses. ... Liquid Cooling revenue of $9.8 million, up from $8.6 million in Q1 2025 and compared with $11 million in Q2 2024."
- **Date:** August 19, 2025
- **Source:** Investing.com, MarketScreener (Asetek Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript and Report)
- **Impact:** Medium-High. While Asetek's liquid cooling revenue increased sequentially, the year-over-year decline in Q2 2025 is a notable data point amidst a booming market for AI liquid cooling. This could indicate specific competitive pressures or shifts in Asetek's customer base/product mix that are not broadly anticipated, potentially signaling a more competitive or fragmented supply chain for NVIDIA's cooling solutions.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The general consensus is strong growth in liquid cooling. A YoY decline from a key player like Asetek is non-consensus.

- **Snippet:** "Asetek expects Liquid Cooling revenue growth to return in 2026 supported by the recent measures to strengthen management, new products widening the addressable market, focused commercial work yielding new customers and closer collaboration with the existing base. ... There is a demand for innovative, high end and new mid market products as well. We do see an, what should I call it, returning an increased focus on quality supply chain and full service. And I think the hidden, meaning of this bullet is that it's not all about low cost."

- **Source:** Investing.com, MarketScreener (Asetek Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript and Report)
- **Impact:** Medium. Asetek's emphasis on "quality supply chain and full service" over "low cost" suggests a potential shift in customer priorities for critical AI infrastructure. This could benefit NVIDIA by ensuring more reliable and robust cooling solutions, but it might also imply higher costs for integrators or end-users, potentially impacting overall system pricing or margins.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market often focuses on cost-efficiency. A shift towards prioritizing quality and full service in the supply chain for such critical components could be a non-consensus insight.

- **Snippet:** "Further to this, Asetek has received certain additional indications of interest relating also to other potential strategic transactions involving the Company. The Company is engaged in discussions with relevant parties, which remain at a preliminary stage. Discussions are ongoing and no definitive agreement in relation to any such potential transaction has been entered into, and there is no certainty that any such potential transaction will be completed."
- **Date:** August 18, 2025
- **Source:** Cision (Asetek Press Release)
- **Impact:** High. Any strategic transaction involving Asetek's liquid cooling business could significantly impact the competitive landscape for NVIDIA's cooling supply chain. A change in ownership or strategic direction for a key provider could lead to shifts in availability, pricing, or technological focus, directly affecting NVIDIA's ability to scale its AI rack deployments.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This is a company-specific development that may not be widely factored into broader NVIDIA supply chain analyses.

- **Snippet:** "In March 2025, CoolIT Systems launched a prototype single-phase liquid cooling cold plate capable of handling approximately 4,000 watts, which can cool chips three times more powerfully than current-gen Nvidia GPUs."
- **Date:** July 15, 2025 (reported in a ResearchAndMarkets.com article)
- **Source:** Business Wire (ResearchAndMarkets.com)
- **Impact:** Medium-High. This demonstrates CoolIT's advanced capabilities and readiness for future, even higher-power NVIDIA GPUs. It signals that at least one key integrator is ahead of the curve in developing solutions for NVIDIA's roadmap, potentially ensuring a robust supply of cutting-edge cooling for future generations of NVIDIA's AI chips.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While CoolIT is a known player, the specific wattage capability of this prototype and its implications for future NVIDIA generations might not be widely appreciated.

- **Snippet:** "Supermicro, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI), a Total IT Solution Provider for AI, HPC, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, today announced the expansion of its NVIDIA Blackwell system portfolio with the new 4U DLC-2 liquid-cooled NVIDIA HGX B200 system ready for volume shipment and the introduction of an air cooled 8U front I/O system. ... 'Supermicro's DLC-2 enabled NVIDIA HGX B200 system leads our portfolio to achieve greater power savings and faster time to online for AI Factory deployments,' said Charles Liang, CEO and president, Supermicro."
- **Date:** August 11, 2025
- **Source:** Supermicro Press Release
- **Impact:** High. Supermicro's announcement of "volume shipment" readiness for its DLC-2 liquid-cooled NVIDIA HGX B200 systems is a strong positive signal for NVIDIA. It indicates that a major partner is prepared to meet the escalating demand for Blackwell-based AI infrastructure, which directly supports NVIDIA's ability to recognize revenue from these high-value systems.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the "volume shipment" aspect and the CEO's direct quote reinforce the positive outlook.

- **Snippet:** "Dell's AI server business is projected to grow by at least $15 billion this year, reflecting the company's aggressive push to supply the backbone of AI factories worldwide. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group reported a 22% increase in revenue, driven by record AI server orders and a growing backlog—clear signals of robust, structural demand."
- **Date:** May 28, 2025
- **Source:** Dell Technologies Press Release
- **Impact:** High. Dell's reported "record AI server orders and a growing backlog" directly linked to NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, along with a projected $15 billion growth in its AI server business, provides strong evidence of sustained and significant demand for NVIDIA's core products. This directly supports a positive outlook for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings and forward guidance.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known that Dell is a key partner, but the specific magnitude of the backlog and growth projection, tied to NVIDIA, is a material data point.
