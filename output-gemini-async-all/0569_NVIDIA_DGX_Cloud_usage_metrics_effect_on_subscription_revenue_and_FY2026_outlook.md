## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, a deep dive into its DGX Cloud usage metrics and their potential impact on subscription revenue and the FY2026 outlook reveals several material, non-consensus insights. While NVIDIA does not break out DGX Cloud revenue separately, recent analyst estimates and company disclosures regarding multi-year cloud service agreements provide a strong indication of its growing financial contribution. Furthermore, the strategic operational model of DGX Cloud and the anticipated impact of new product deployments like Blackwell are key factors to consider.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "UBS Group analysts expect its annual revenue to exceed 10 billion dollars."
    *   **Date:** June 25, 2025
    *   **Source:** Moomoo, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGOXMgfHqYdgDgM4MivC8HIdW_g5Sq3gCi8IC6Ces13z9k4oBCeIerwZ_x7DnIKOBPoI0E27cor4jyhubhl0sztsMKyLCkjzLSB-5JRUwJYjbVhIrSMQ41-v8HMpMhnqVhh2JXnxupYaSjs83AAIiX5qBFZ6_HDH4a9wrFKGqQNxsyT1hnxZhq3gU7aI48G4ec9HUTjdxrHoAChps48ba3NnEbyrf4A2NM8-gdFh8InH8k=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGOXMgfHqYdgDgM4MivC8HIdW_g5Sq3gCi8IC6Ces13z9k4oBCeIerwZ_x7DnIKOBPoI0E27cor4jyhubhl0sztsMKyLCkjzLSB-5JRUwJYjbVhIrSMQ41-v8HMpMhnqVhh2JXnxupYaSjs83AAIiX5qBFZ6_HDH4a9wrFKGqQNxsyT1hnxZhq3gU7aI48G4ec9HUTjdxrHoAChps48ba3NnEbyrf4A2NM8-gdFh8InH8k=)
    *   **Impact:** High. This specific analyst projection for DGX Cloud's annual revenue, exceeding $10 billion, is a significant forward-looking indicator of the segment's growth potential and its increasing contribution to NVIDIA's overall revenue, even though it's not separately reported by the company.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA highlights its software and services growth, a specific analyst estimate for DGX Cloud's standalone annual revenue of this magnitude is likely not fully priced into the market or widely discussed in consensus estimates.

*   **Snippet:** "the company stated it signed multi-year cloud service agreements worth 10.9 billion dollars in the latest fiscal year, up from 3.5 billion dollars the previous year, largely to support DGX Cloud."
    *   **Date:** June 25, 2025
    *   **Source:** Moomoo, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGOXMgfHqYdgDgM4MivC8HIdW_g5Sq3gCi8IC6Ces13z9k4oBCeIerwZ_x7DnIKOBPoI0E27cor4jyhubhl0sztsMKyLCkjzLSB-5JRUwJYjbVhIrSMQ41-v8HMpMhnqVhh2JXnxupYaSjs83AAIiX5qBFZ6_HDH4a9wrFKGqQNxsyT1hnxZhq3gU7aI48G4ec9HUTjdxrHoAChps48ba3NnEbyrf4A2NM8-gdFh8InH8k=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGOXMgfHqYdgDgM4MivC8HIdW_g5Sq3gCi8IC6Ces13z9k4oBCeIerwZ_x7DnIKOBPoI0E27cor4jyhubhl0sztsMKyLCkjzLSB-5JRUwJYjbVhIrSMQ41-v8HMpMhnqVhh2JXnxupYaSjs83AAIiX5qBFZ6_HDH4a9wrFKGqQNxsyT1hnxZhq3gU7aI48G4ec9HUTjdxrHoAChps48ba3NnEbyrf4A2NM8-gdFh8InH8k=)
    *   **Impact:** High. This significant increase in multi-year cloud service agreements, explicitly linked to DGX Cloud support, demonstrates strong underlying demand and a rapidly expanding revenue stream for NVIDIA's cloud offerings. The substantial year-over-year growth (from $3.5 billion to $10.9 billion) is a material indicator of accelerated adoption.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific magnitude and growth rate might be underappreciated. While NVIDIA reports overall data center revenue, the direct link and growth of these specific cloud service agreements for DGX Cloud may not be fully factored into all analyst models.

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA is adopting a dual strategy in AI cloud computing: directly operating the DGX Cloud service while also investing in emerging cloud computing companies like CoreWeave and Lambda... DGX Cloud adopts a different operation model: the cloud computing giants are responsible for purchasing and managing equipment, including NVIDIA chips, which form the service infrastructure. Then, NVIDIA rents these devices back from them and subleases them to enterprise clients while providing AI expert support and software services."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This detailed explanation of NVIDIA's dual strategy and the unique operational model for DGX Cloud highlights a sophisticated approach to the cloud computing market. It suggests a more capital-efficient and flexible model for NVIDIA, potentially leading to higher margins and broader market penetration without direct ownership of all infrastructure.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the partnerships are known, the specific nuances of this "rent-back and sublease" model and the strategic investments in emerging cloud players are likely not fully appreciated by all investors, offering a deeper understanding of NVIDIA's long-term cloud strategy.

*   **Snippet:** "Prior reporting from Tom's Hardware suggests analysts believe the GB200 server racks will cost $3 million." and "The upcoming GB300 Blackwell Ultra launch, already deployed with CoreWeave (CRWV), will, once again, raise compute density while lowering the token price per piece for inference workloads."
    *   **Date:** August 22, 2025, July 21, 2025
    *   **Source:** Tom's Hardware (via article), Seeking Alpha
    *   **Impact:** High. The estimated $3 million price tag for GB200 server racks underscores the immense revenue potential per unit for NVIDIA's next-generation hardware. The deployment with CoreWeave and the stated benefits of increased compute density and lower inference costs for DGX Cloud users suggest a strong value proposition that could drive further adoption and revenue growth for NVIDIA's cloud services.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known for the Blackwell launch, but the specific $3 million price point for racks and the immediate deployment impact on inference costs for DGX Cloud users might be less granularly understood by the broader market.

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
    *   **Date:** May 28, 2025, August 19, 2025
    *   **Source:** NVIDIA Financial Results, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented Revenue & Earnings
    *   **Impact:** High. This is NVIDIA's official Q2 FY2026 revenue guidance, but the explicit quantification of an $8.0 billion revenue loss from H20 due to export controls is highly material. It allows investors to gauge the underlying demand for NVIDIA's products outside of the impacted China market and provides a clearer picture of the core business's strength.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This is official company guidance, so it is factored into consensus estimates. However, the specific magnitude of the China impact ($8.0 billion) is a critical detail for understanding the quality of the guidance.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding DGX Cloud's growth or strategic direction within the recent timeframe.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   **Specific DGX Cloud Usage Metrics:** While revenue estimates and contract values are provided, granular usage metrics such as the number of active DGX Cloud instances, average utilization rates, or growth in specific customer segments (e.g., enterprise vs. startups) are not available.
    *   **Profitability of DGX Cloud:** NVIDIA does not separately disclose the revenue and profit specifically from DGX Cloud, making it challenging to assess its direct contribution to the company's profitability.
    *   **Competitive Impact on DGX Cloud:** While the broader competitive landscape for AI chips is discussed, specific competitive pressures or advantages for the DGX Cloud service itself (beyond the general strength of NVIDIA's ecosystem) are not detailed.
    *   **Long-term Subscription Revenue Projections:** While multi-year agreements are mentioned, detailed long-term projections for recurring subscription revenue specifically from DGX Cloud are not provided.
