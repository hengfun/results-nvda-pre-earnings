## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to release its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025, a key area of non-consensus information revolves around the emerging competition from Tenstorrent, particularly its RISC-V-based AI designs, and recent, conflicting reports regarding NVIDIA's H20 chip sales in China. While analyst consensus points to strong Q2 performance for NVIDIA, these underlying competitive dynamics and geopolitical shifts could introduce material, non-consensus risks or opportunities.

Tenstorrent, led by chip industry veteran Jim Keller, is positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to NVIDIA's dominant AI hardware. Recent disclosures about Tenstorrent's "Blackhole" AI accelerators suggest a direct challenge to NVIDIA's established products. Concurrently, the volatile situation surrounding NVIDIA's H20 chip in the crucial Chinese market presents a significant, evolving narrative that could impact forward-looking guidance.

### Key Findings:

**1. Tenstorrent's Blackhole RISC-V AI Accelerators Challenge NVIDIA A100 Performance**

*   **Snippet:** "Tenstorrent shows how its latest chip can offer a modest advantage in performance over an Nvidia A100 GPU, though it falls behind in both memory capacity and bandwidth. Each Blackhole chip boasts 745 teraFLOPS of FP8 performance (372 teraFLOPS at FP16), 32GB of GDDR6 memory and an Ethernet-based interconnect capable of 1TBps of total bandwidth across its 10 400Gbps links."
*   **Date:** 2024-08-27
*   **Source:** The Register, [https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/27/tenstorrent_blackhole_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/27/tenstorrent_blackhole_chips/)
*   **Impact:** High. While the A100 is an older generation NVIDIA GPU, a new competitor claiming performance advantages in raw compute and scalability with a different architecture (RISC-V) indicates a credible, albeit nascent, threat to NVIDIA's long-term dominance in certain segments, particularly where cost-efficiency and open standards are prioritized. This could pressure NVIDIA's pricing or market share in specific inference workloads over time.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Tenstorrent is known as a competitor, specific performance claims against an NVIDIA product, particularly with detailed technical specifications and a focus on RISC-V, are not widely integrated into mainstream NVIDIA earnings analyses.

**2. Tenstorrent's Open Chiplet Strategy and RISC-V Adoption in AI/HPC**

*   **Snippet:** "The rise of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) is accelerating the adoption of RISC-V, the open-source instruction set architecture that is reshaping the global semiconductor landscape. At the recent 5th RISC-V Summit China in Shanghai, AI chip startup Tenstorrent unveiled its long-term open computing roadmap."

*   **Impact:** Medium. Tenstorrent's commitment to an open-source RISC-V and chiplet strategy, particularly with a long-term roadmap, signals a foundational shift in the AI hardware ecosystem. This approach could attract customers seeking greater flexibility, customization, and potentially lower costs compared to NVIDIA's proprietary stack, gradually eroding NVIDIA's ecosystem lock-in over the longer term.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The broader market acknowledges RISC-V's growth, but Tenstorrent's specific role in accelerating its adoption for AI/HPC and its "open computing roadmap" are niche details not typically factored into short-term NVIDIA earnings forecasts.

**3. Contradictory Reports on NVIDIA's H20 Chip Production for China**

*   **Snippet 1 (Halt):** "Nvidia is halting production of an artificial-intelligence chip it developed for China after the government in Beijing told companies not to buy it, the latest twist in the U.S.-China tech war centered on the $4 trillion chip designer."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-23
*   **Source:** Mint, [https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/nvidias-roller-coaster-for-china-ai-chips-takes-a-new-turn-11724392823377.html](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/nvidias-roller-coaster-for-china-ai-chips-takes-a-new-turn-11724392823377.html)
*   **Snippet 2 (Suspension):** "Despite this robust outlook, Nvidia faces potential headwinds from China export curbs, which could result in an $8 billion hit. The company has reportedly told suppliers to suspend production of its H20 chip due to security concerns raised by Beijing."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-24
*   **Source:** AInvest, [https://www.ainvest.com/news/nvidia-stock-poised-for-another-earnings-beat-as-q2-fy-2026-results-approach-250824007823a07010](https://www.ainvest.com/news/nvidia-stock-poised-for-another-earnings-beat-as-q2-fy-2026-results-approach-250824007823a07010)
*   **Snippet 3 (Resumed Supply):** "Despite bouts of security scrutiny, including concerns over potential backdoor vulnerabilities which led to discussions with regulatory authorities in China, the H20 chip remains a pivotal part of Nvidia's offerings in the AI space in China. ... Despite such hurdles, the company has resumed supply to the Chinese market, highlighting its ongoing navigation of a geopolitically complex environment."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-08
*   **Source:** AInvest, [https://www.ainvest.com/news/nvidia-s-china-strategy-and-new-chip-releases-set-to-drive-momentum-amid-high-market-expectations-250808007823a07010](https://www.ainvest.com/news/nvidia-s-china-strategy-and-new-chip-releases-set-to-drive-momentum-amid-high-market-expectations-250808007823a07010)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a critical, non-consensus point. The most recent reports (August 23rd and 24th) indicating a halt or suspension of H20 production due to Beijing's directives directly contradict an earlier August 8th report of resumed supply. If the halt is confirmed, it represents a significant and immediate negative impact on NVIDIA's revenue, particularly from its data center business, which has been a primary growth engine, potentially leading to an $8 billion hit. This uncertainty and the latest negative development are likely not fully priced into consensus expectations.
*   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus/Contradictory. The market has been aware of China export curbs, but the specific, recent reports of a *halt* in H20 production, directly contradicting earlier "resumed supply" news, is a rapidly developing and potentially overlooked material event.

**4. NVIDIA Q2 FY2026 Earnings Expectations and Blackwell Ramp**

*   **Snippet:** "Q2 revenues are expected at $46.14b (+5% q/q), marginally above prior guidance, with data centres at $41b. Analysts anticipate guidance for Q3 revenues of $53.2b (+53.6% y/y). ... Progress on the Blackwell ramp, as well as updates on other key product innovations and demand trends, will feed into market models for ongoing sales and margin growth."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-25
*   **Source:** Pepperstone, [https://www.pepperstone.com/en-us/market-analysis/nvidia-q2-2026-earnings-key-expectations-and-market-implications/](https://www.pepperstone.com/en-us/market-analysis/nvidia-q2-2026-earnings-key-expectations-and-market-implications/)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While this is consensus information, it provides the backdrop against which the non-consensus items will be judged. Any deviation from these high expectations, especially concerning Blackwell's ramp or data center performance, amplified by competitive threats or China issues, could have a magnified impact.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. These are median analyst expectations and a core part of the market's current valuation of NVIDIA.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

The most significant contradiction lies in the status of NVIDIA's H20 chip sales and production for China. Recent reports (August 23rd and 24th) indicate a halt or suspension of production due to Beijing's directives, while an earlier report (August 8th) suggested resumed supply. This creates a material gap in understanding the current revenue potential from the Chinese market, which analysts have previously estimated could result in an $8 billion hit. The market's reaction will heavily depend on clarity provided by NVIDIA during the earnings call regarding this critical geopolitical and business development.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report is set against a backdrop of incredibly high expectations, with analysts forecasting robust revenue and EPS driven by strong AI demand and the ramp-up of its Blackwell GPUs. However, two key areas present potential for non-consensus information that could significantly sway investor sentiment.

Firstly, the competitive landscape is subtly shifting with Tenstorrent's advancements in RISC-V-based AI accelerators. While Tenstorrent is a smaller player, its "Blackhole" chips are reportedly demonstrating performance advantages over NVIDIA's A100 in raw compute and scalability, albeit with less memory. This, coupled with Tenstorrent's open-source and cost-effective strategy, could appeal to a segment of the market looking for alternatives to NVIDIA's proprietary and often expensive solutions. While unlikely to impact Q2 FY2026 earnings directly, any commentary from NVIDIA on competitive pressures or the evolving RISC-V ecosystem could be material for forward guidance.

Secondly, and more immediately impactful, is the conflicting information surrounding NVIDIA's H20 chip for the Chinese market. Recent reports from late August suggest that NVIDIA has halted or suspended production of the H20 chip after Beijing instructed companies not to purchase it. This directly contradicts earlier reports from early August indicating a resumption of supply. Given the significant revenue potential from China and the estimated $8 billion impact from export curbs, any definitive update on the H20's status will be crucial. A confirmed halt would be a negative surprise, potentially leading to a downward revision of future guidance, while a clarification of resumed sales could alleviate concerns. Investors will be closely scrutinizing CEO Jensen Huang's comments for clarity on this highly fluid and geopolitically sensitive issue. The market's current bullishness may not fully account for the latest negative developments regarding the H20 chip.
