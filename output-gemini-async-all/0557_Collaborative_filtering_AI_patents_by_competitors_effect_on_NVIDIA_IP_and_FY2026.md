## Analysis

The research query focused on "Collaborative filtering AI patents by competitors effect on NVIDIA IP and FY2026 outlook." While direct, material, non-consensus information specifically on *collaborative filtering AI patents* by competitors impacting NVIDIA's IP and FY2026 outlook was not found within the last three months, the broader search revealed significant competitive pressures and IP-related challenges that are highly relevant to NVIDIA's upcoming earnings and forward-looking guidance. These include aggressive advancements from competitors like AMD, ongoing antitrust investigations into NVIDIA's market practices, and the emergence of highly efficient AI models that could impact demand for NVIDIA's advanced chips.

Here are the key findings, prioritizing those that represent potential non-consensus or material impacts:

---

**Findings:**

-   **Snippet:** "AMD says they offer up to four times more AI compute compared to the previous generation, and support standard rack configurations with both air and liquid cooling. The company showed inference throughput gains of 3x to 4.2x over its previous generation when running models like LLaMA 3.1 and DeepSeek. On training, AMD claims the MI355 can deliver 3.5x higher throughput in pretraining and up to 2.9x more performance in fine-tuning. It also reported up to 13% faster training times compared to Nvidia's B200, using recent MLPerf 5.0 benchmarks."

    *   **Source:** Advancing AI 2025: New AMD GPUs and rack design aim at cheaper AI compute, URL not available in snippet.
    *   **Impact:** High. AMD's direct performance claims against NVIDIA's B200, particularly in training times and inference throughput for models like LLaMA 3.1 and DeepSeek, represent a significant competitive challenge. If these benchmarks gain wider industry acceptance and translate into increased market share for AMD, it could directly impact NVIDIA's data center revenue growth and pricing power in FY226.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While AMD's competitive efforts are generally known, the specific performance claims against NVIDIA's latest offerings and the potential for market share shifts might be underappreciated by some investors who still view NVIDIA as having an unassailable lead.

-   **Snippet (Combined): A) "The US Department of Justice is investigating complaints made against Nvidia by its competitors alleging that the AI chipmaker is actively stifling competition in the chips market." B) "Regulators are also reportedly concerned about the number of AI start-ups being acquired by Nvidia to strengthen its grip on the software used by AI developers, Politico reports." C) "The DOJ sent subpoenas to Nvidia after rivals raised concerns suggesting that Nvidia promotes exclusive use of its chips and prioritizes customers that can immediately use its products, as well as that its recent acquisitions, particularly the purchase of AI management firm RunAI, foreclose competition from potential rivals."
    *   **Date:** 2024-08-02 (Snippet A, B), 2024-10-07 (Snippet C). While the articles are from 2024, they were found in a search filtered for the last 3 months, indicating ongoing relevance and potential for new developments. The "Nvidia faces US antitrust probe amid complaints from competitors" article was published on August 2, 2024, but was returned in the search, suggesting its content is still considered current in the context of ongoing investigations.
    *   **Source:** Silicon Republic (for A, B), AAF (for C). URLs not available in snippets.
    *   **Impact:** High. Ongoing antitrust investigations by the US Department of Justice, coupled with concerns about NVIDIA's acquisition strategy and alleged anti-competitive practices, could lead to regulatory actions. These actions might restrict NVIDIA's ability to acquire key AI startups, bundle software with hardware, or engage in certain sales tactics, potentially hindering its full-stack AI strategy and long-term IP expansion. This could impact future guidance more than immediate earnings.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While antitrust probes are public, the specific implications for NVIDIA's IP strategy and the potential for remedies that could alter its competitive landscape might not be fully priced into the stock, especially regarding future acquisitions and ecosystem control.

-   **Snippet:** "Despite strong momentum, challenges persist. Highly efficient AI models from competitors like China's DeepSeek pose long-term threats to advanced chips demand."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-22 (for both snippets)
    *   **Source:** NVIDIA Q2 2026 earnings preview: AI growth, China chip deal, analyst forecast (IG); How will AI growth and US-China deal shape NVIDIA's Q2 results? (FastBull). URLs not available in snippets.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. The emergence of highly efficient AI models, such as those from China's DeepSeek, could reduce the demand for the most advanced, high-cost AI chips over the long term. While not an immediate threat to Q2 FY2026 earnings, it represents a potential headwind for NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance as customers might opt for less powerful but more cost-effective solutions for certain workloads.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While the general competitive landscape is known, the specific impact of "highly efficient AI models" on demand for NVIDIA's *most advanced* chips might be a nuanced point that some investors could overlook in the broader narrative of insatiable AI demand.

-   **Snippet:** "Nvidia says it will allow customers to use rival chipmakers in an effort to expand its AI ecosystem, and Apple has been spending billions of dollars on AI but insiders say it still can't get it right."
    *   **Date:** 2025-05-19
    *   **Source:** Nvidia Opens AI Ecosystem to Rivals, Apple AI Struggles | Bloomberg Technology. URL not available in snippet.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. NVIDIA's strategic decision to open its AI ecosystem to rival chipmakers could be interpreted in several ways. It might be a proactive move to address antitrust concerns or to broaden the overall adoption of its software stack, even if it means some hardware sales go to competitors. This could impact NVIDIA's long-term strategy and potentially its revenue mix, but the immediate impact on Q2 FY2026 earnings is less clear.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. This move could be seen as a defensive play or a strategic expansion, and its full implications for NVIDIA's competitive moat and future revenue streams might not be fully understood or priced in by all investors.

-   **Snippet:** "Despite its formidable growth, Nvidia may face some troublesome legal consequences due to a recent patent lawsuit filed by a tech startup, Xockets Inc.. Xockets Inc., a small Texas-based company founded in 2012, sued Nvidia and Microsoft for stealing its data processor technology—specifically, its New Cloud Processor and New Cloud Fabric technology that Xockets sought to license. In the complaint, Xockets alleged that its Data Processing Unit (DPU) technology was the key element in Nvidia's explosive success in recent years."
    *   **Date:** 2025-03-24
    *   **Source:** The Future of Nvidia in Light of Recent Patent Infringement Lawsuit, URL not available in snippet.
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium. A patent infringement lawsuit, particularly one alleging theft of core DPU technology, could have long-term financial and reputational consequences for NVIDIA. While unlikely to materially impact Q2 FY2026 earnings directly, it introduces legal uncertainty and could lead to significant damages or injunctions in the future, affecting NVIDIA's IP portfolio and its ability to market certain technologies.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. Patent lawsuits against large tech companies are common, but one challenging the foundational IP of a key product like DPUs, which Xockets claims are central to NVIDIA's success, could be overlooked by some investors focusing solely on demand and supply metrics.
