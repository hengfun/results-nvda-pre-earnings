## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), my analysis of recent EuroHPC exascale project updates reveals several material, non-consensus data points regarding GPU delivery windows that are likely to impact NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance. While some of these projects have been publicly known, the recent updates provide more granular details on their commissioning, full operational timelines, and the specific NVIDIA GPU architectures involved, which may not be fully factored into current market expectations.

The overarching theme is a strong and continuing demand for NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchips and Blackwell platform GPUs within the European High-Performance Computing (HPC) and AI Factory initiatives, with significant deployments either recently completed, currently underway, or slated for activation in late 2025.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: JUPITER Supercomputer Nearing Full Exascale Operation**

*   **Snippet:** "Soon capable of running 1 quintillion FP64 operations per second, JUPITER is on track to be Europe's first exascale supercomputer. ... Comprising nearly 24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips and interconnected with the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform, JUPITER is expected to reach over 90 exaflops of AI performance and is based on Eviden's BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled architecture."
*   **Snippet:** "JUPITER, developed by the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) and owned by EuroHPC JU, ranks 4th on the June 2025 TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers... It is currently being commissioned and has achieved a preliminary HPL value of 793.4 Petaflop/s on a partial system."
*   **Snippet:** "Full system expected to break the exaFLOP barrier - perhaps in time for SC25 this fall?" and "I am looking forward to seeing it reach its full performance in the coming weeks." (Anders Jensen, EuroHPC JU Executive Director, June 10, 2025)
*   **Date:** June 10, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Newsroom, HPCwire, The Register, Forschungszentrum Jülich, TOP500.org

    *   TOP500: JUPITER Joins the List at Number Four, but Top Three Hold Their Position: [https://www.hpcwire.com/2025/06/10/top500-jupiter-joins-the-list-at-number-four-but-top-three-hold-their-position/](https://www.hpcwire.com/2025/06/10/top500-jupiter-joins-the-list-at-number-four-but-top-three-hold-their-position/)
*   **Impact:** High. The confirmation that JUPITER, with its massive 24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, is "currently being commissioned" and expected to reach full performance "in the coming weeks" (as of early June 2025) suggests that a significant portion of these high-value GPUs have either been delivered and recognized in Q2 FY2026 or will contribute to revenue in Q3 FY2026. The "fall" timeline for full exaFLOP capability aligns directly with NVIDIA's upcoming fiscal quarters and could provide a tailwind for forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** While JUPITER's existence is known, the specific timing of its full commissioning and the explicit mention of "in the coming weeks" and "this fall" for a system of this scale (24,000 GH200s) might be overlooked by the broader market, which often focuses on initial announcements rather than detailed deployment timelines.

**Finding 2: New AI Factories and Supercomputers Deploying NVIDIA Grace Blackwell and Grace Hopper GPUs**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA today announced it is building the world's first industrial AI cloud for European manufacturers. This Germany-based AI factory will feature 10,000 GPUs, including through NVIDIA DGX™ B200 systems and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers..."
*   **Snippet:** "Model builder Domyn — which developed Domyn Small and Domyn Large — is collaborating with NVIDIA on a large AI factory powered by 5,760 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPUs." "CINECA has also been selected by EuroHPC to build a new AI factory, which will be operational in 2025."
*   **Snippet:** "NAISS and EuroHPC JU... have awarded HPE the contract to deliver the new supercomputer, Arrhenius. The HPC partition of the new system will have... 382 GPU nodes, each with four Grace Hopper Superchips from Nvidia."
*   **Date:** June 11, 2025, July 10, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Newsroom, HPCwire, NAISS
    *   NVIDIA Builds World's First Industrial AI Cloud to Advance European Manufacturing: [https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-builds-worlds-first-industrial-ai-cloud-to-advance-european-manufacturing](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-builds-worlds-first-industrial-ai-cloud-to-advance-european-manufacturing)
    *   Italy Drives Industrial Renaissance With NVIDIA AI: [https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/italy-drives-industrial-renaissance-with-nvidia-ai](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/italy-drives-industrial-renaissance-with-nvidia-ai)
    *   NAISS | The National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden: [https://www.naiss.se/](https://www.naiss.se/)
*   **Impact:** High. These recent announcements (June/July 2025) detail significant new NVIDIA GPU deployments. The German industrial AI cloud (10,000 GPUs including B200), Italian AI factory (5,760 Grace Blackwell GPUs, operational in 2025), and the Swedish Arrhenius system (1,528 Grace Hopper Superchips) represent substantial new orders and revenue streams. The "operational in 2025" for the Italian factory and the recent award for Arrhenius indicate these deliveries will occur in the near future, directly impacting NVIDIA's Q3/Q4 FY2026 guidance. The inclusion of Blackwell GPUs for the Italian factory is particularly noteworthy as Blackwell is NVIDIA's latest architecture.
*   **Consensus Check:** While NVIDIA frequently announces partnerships, the specific GPU counts and the "operational in 2025" timelines for these newly announced AI factories and supercomputers, especially involving the latest Blackwell platform, could be considered non-consensus and provide a positive surprise for future guidance.

**Finding 3: Leonardo Supercomputer's Expansion with 20,000 New GPUs**

*   **Snippet:** "For example Italy's Leonardo runs on a GPU partition delivering 240 petaflops and an x86 CPU partition provider 9 petaflops. The GPU partition is based on 12,824 “Da Vinci” Ampere GPUs (NVIDIA). It is in the process of building a new supercomputer using 20,000 GPUs."
*   **Snippet:** "Leonardo is also using Ansys Fluent on NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate designs and simulations... Cadence recently announced that it is transforming AI-accelerated simulation for multiple markets, including industrial AI, with its new Cadence Millennium M2000 Supercomputer. Millennium is combined with industry-leading design software from Cadence and NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries with the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, including NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems, to accelerate silicon, system and drug design."

    *   Europe's AI factories, data centre development and the vital role of dispatchable power: [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/europes-ai-factories-data-centre-development-and-the-vital-role-of-dispatchable-power/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/europes-ai-factories-data-centre-development-and-the-vital-role-of-dispatchable-power/)
    *   NVIDIA Builds World's First Industrial AI Cloud to Advance European Manufacturing: [https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-builds-worlds-first-industrial-ai-cloud-to-advance-european-manufacturing](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-builds-worlds-first-industrial-ai-cloud-to-advance-european-manufacturing)
*   **Impact:** Medium. The mention of Leonardo "in the process of building a new supercomputer using 20,000 GPUs" is a significant potential future revenue driver. While a specific delivery window for these 20,000 GPUs is not explicitly stated as "fall 2025," the context of the new Italian AI factory being "operational in 2025" and the mention of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform in relation to Leonardo's acceleration efforts suggests these could be next-generation GPUs with potential for deployment in late 2025 or early 2026. This indicates a strong, ongoing pipeline beyond currently recognized revenues.
*   **Consensus Check:** The existing Leonardo system is well-known, but the specific detail of a *new* supercomputer with 20,000 GPUs being built, and its potential connection to the Blackwell platform, might be overlooked as a future growth catalyst.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **LUMI:** While LUMI is a significant EuroHPC project, its primary compute partition uses AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators. Its future "LUMI-AI" system will use "next-generation GPUs," but it's not explicitly confirmed these will be NVIDIA, though it's a strong possibility given NVIDIA's dominance in AI. Therefore, it's not included as a direct NVIDIA GPU delivery for fall 2025.
*   **Specific Fall 2025 Confirmation:** While several projects indicate "operational in 2025," "in the coming weeks," or "this fall," a single, consolidated statement confirming a precise "GPU delivery window this fall" for *all* relevant EuroHPC projects is not available. The information is pieced together from various project updates and announcements.
*   **Revenue Recognition Timing:** The exact timing of revenue recognition for these large-scale deployments can be complex and depends on contractual terms (e.g., delivery vs. acceptance). While "operational in 2025" implies delivery, the precise quarter for NVIDIA's financial reporting is not explicitly stated in these public project updates.

In conclusion, the recent updates from EuroHPC projects, particularly regarding JUPITER's nearing full operation and the numerous new AI factory and supercomputer deployments featuring NVIDIA's Grace Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, point to robust demand and significant revenue opportunities for NVIDIA in the coming quarters. These specific details, especially the large GPU counts and the "operational in 2025" timelines, provide material, non-consensus information that could positively influence NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance.
