## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective is to identify material, non-consensus information regarding H100 and H200 secondary market ask prices that could impact the Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. While precise, direct comparisons of "July vs. August" secondary market ask prices for physical H100/H200 GPUs on platforms like eBay or specific broker sites are not explicitly detailed with exact month-over-month figures in the most recent web content, several recent reports provide strong directional cues and insights into the underlying supply and demand dynamics.

The overall trend suggests a complex market. While demand for NVIDIA's high-end GPUs remains robust, particularly for immediate AI workloads, there are increasing signs of supply easing and growing competition, which could put downward pressure on prices in certain segments. The impending release of newer generations (Blackwell) also influences the market for current models.

**Key Findings:**

*   **H100 Prices Maintained by Demand, but Supply Increasing:** The release of the H200 has, in some instances, helped maintain high prices for the H100 as organizations awaiting next-generation GPUs continue to rely on the H100 for immediate AI workloads. However, an influx of previously committed H100s is expected as long-term contracts with large organizations come to an end, creating additional supply in the market.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates a potential softening of the H100 market in the near future due to increased supply, which could affect NVIDIA's pricing power or sales volumes for the H100 if not offset by new demand.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is a nuanced view. While strong demand is widely known, the increasing supply from expiring contracts might be overlooked by some, especially if the focus is solely on new chip production.

*   **H200 Cloud Rental Prices Saw June Cut:** As of August 2025, an analysis of on-demand NVIDIA H200 hourly prices across various cloud providers indicated that even after AWS's June price cut, the cheapest hyperscaler H200 hour remained significantly more expensive than an A100. Specialist cloud providers offered H200 rentals in the $2-$4 range per hour.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. A price cut by a major hyperscaler like AWS in June suggests increasing competition or improved supply for H200 cloud instances, which could indirectly influence the secondary market for physical units or signal a broader trend of price adjustments.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Cloud rental price adjustments are generally known, but the specific timing of AWS's June cut for H200 might be a more granular detail.

*   **H100 Secondary Market Prices Robust in Early 2025:** As of early 2025, introductory listings for new H100 GPUs on the secondary/resale market were starting near $40,000, with used units still commanding over $30,000, depending on condition and warranty.
    *   **Impact:** Low. While this indicates strong pricing earlier in the year, it doesn't provide a direct July vs. August comparison. However, it sets a baseline for the high value of these GPUs.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The high price of H100s on the secondary market has been widely reported.

*   **H100 Cloud Pricing Decreased Significantly in 2025:** Cloud pricing for H100 GPUs experienced substantial decreases throughout 2025, with hourly rates dropping from historical highs of $8 to a more competitive range of $2.85-$3.50. This reduction was attributed to increased market supply, more data center providers, improved H100 availability, and growing competition among cloud providers.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Although this refers to cloud pricing and not direct secondary market ask prices for physical units, the trend of increased supply and competition in the cloud market for H100s is likely to exert some downward pressure or stabilize prices in the broader secondary market for physical GPUs by July and August.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The general trend of cloud GPU price adjustments due to supply and competition is likely known, but the specific magnitude of the H100 price drop in cloud services throughout 2025 might be a more detailed insight.

**Inference for July vs. August Secondary Market Ask Prices:**

Based on the available information published within the last three months:

*   **NVIDIA H100:** Secondary market ask prices for H100s likely remained robust in July and August due to continued demand for immediate AI workloads. However, the increasing supply from expiring long-term contracts and the significant decreases in cloud rental rates throughout 2025 suggest that any upward movement in ask prices would have been tempered, and stabilization or slight downward pressure is more probable. There is no clear indication of a significant increase in ask prices for H100s between July and August.
*   **NVIDIA H200:** For H200s, the cloud rental market saw a price cut from AWS in June, implying that prices in the cloud segment were *down* in July and August compared to earlier in Q2 FY2026. While this doesn't directly translate to secondary market ask prices for physical units, it suggests that the initial premium for H200s might be facing downward pressure as supply improves and competition intensifies.

**Conclusion:**

While direct "July vs. August" secondary market ask price data is not explicitly available, the overall trend from recent publications suggests that H100 prices, while still high, are facing increasing supply pressures from expiring contracts and competition from cloud offerings. H200 cloud rental prices saw a notable cut in June, indicating a potential easing of pricing for the newer generation as well. This points to a market where the extreme upward pressure on prices seen in earlier periods might be moderating, which could be a non-consensus factor impacting NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance if not fully anticipated by the market.
