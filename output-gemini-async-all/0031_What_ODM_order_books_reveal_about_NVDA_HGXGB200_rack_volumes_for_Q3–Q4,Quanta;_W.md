## Analysis

Here's an analysis of NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings, focusing on material, non-consensus information regarding HGX/GB200 rack volumes for Q3–Q4 FY2026 (calendar Q3–Q4 2025), based on web content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The recent reports from major Taiwanese Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and industry research firm TrendForce paint a largely optimistic picture for NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell platforms, including GB200 and GB300 racks, for the latter half of 2025. While earlier reports (outside our 3-month filter) hinted at potential delays and reduced shipment forecasts, the latest information suggests these challenges are being addressed, with a ramp-up observed in Q2 and continued growth expected.

Quanta Computer, a key NVIDIA partner, has indicated a strong Q2 FY2026 for AI server revenue, expecting it to constitute 65-70% of its total server sales, and maintains a triple-digit growth outlook for AI server revenue this year. Crucially, Quanta aims to begin shipments of GB300 servers as early as September, with pilot runs by the end of Q3 and small shipments by Q4. This suggests that the transition to the even newer GB300 platform is on track, potentially boosting NVIDIA's revenue in the coming quarters. However, Quanta also noted a 16.6% sequential drop in July revenue due to a product transition, as customers shifted orders to new-generation AI servers, which could introduce some short-term volatility.

Wiwynn Corporation also reported exceptional Q2 FY2026 results, with consolidated revenue surging 184.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by strong demand for both general and AI servers. Wiwynn remains optimistic about long-term data center market growth and is expanding its manufacturing capabilities, including a new facility in Texas slated for production by year-end 2025. This robust performance from another major ODM reinforces the strong underlying demand for NVIDIA's AI solutions.

TrendForce's latest investigations confirm that shipments of Blackwell-based platforms, including GB200 racks and HGX B200, gradually ramped up in Q2 FY2026. The next-generation B300 and GB300 series are now in the sampling and validation phase. TrendForce projects that Blackwell GPUs will account for over 80% of NVIDIA's high-end GPU shipments in 2025, highlighting the significant market adoption expected for these new architectures. Specific ODM engagements, such as Quanta securing additional Oracle orders for GB200/GB300 racks and Wiwynn deepening collaborations with Meta and Microsoft, further underscore the strong customer pull.

Inventec's monthly revenue data shows a sequential dip in July 2025 after strong May and June figures. While not explicitly tied to AI server transitions in the provided snippet, this trend mirrors Quanta's reported July dip due to product transitions, suggesting a broader, albeit temporary, impact across ODMs as the industry shifts to newer, more complex AI server configurations.

Overall, the picture emerging from the supply chain is one of strong, sustained demand for NVIDIA's AI platforms, with the transition to the latest Blackwell architectures (GB200/GB300) progressing. While some short-term revenue fluctuations due to product transitions are noted, the long-term outlook for AI server growth remains highly positive, driven by hyperscaler demand and ODM expansion.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** There are no direct contradictions among the *recent* (last 3 months) snippets. However, the current positive outlook and ramp-up for GB200/GB300 from July/August 2025 sources (Quanta, Wiwynn, TrendForce) implicitly contradict earlier reports (outside the 3-month filter, e.g., March 2025 Reddit post or February 2025 IO Fund article) that suggested significant delays and reduced shipment forecasts for GB200/GB300 racks for 2025. This suggests that earlier reported issues may have been largely resolved or that market expectations have adjusted.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   **Specific Rack Volume Numbers for Q3-Q4 2025:** While the snippets confirm a ramp-up and expected growth, concrete, quantifiable rack volume numbers for GB200/GB300 from individual ODMs for Q3 and Q4 2025 are still largely absent. TrendForce projects Blackwell GPUs to account for over 80% of NVIDIA's high-end GPU shipments in 2025, but this is a GPU unit projection, not a rack volume.
    *   **Detailed Inventec AI Server Outlook:** While Inventec's overall monthly revenue is available, specific commentary on its GB200/GB300 rack volumes or AI server revenue contribution for Q3-Q4 2025 is not as detailed as for Quanta and Wiwynn in the recent snippets. Its July revenue dip, while potentially linked to product transitions, lacks explicit confirmation for AI servers.
    *   **Full Impact of Product Transitions:** Quanta explicitly mentioned a July revenue dip due to product transitions. While Inventec also saw a July dip, the full extent and financial impact of these transitions across all ODMs, and how they might affect NVIDIA's Q3 guidance, remains a gap.
