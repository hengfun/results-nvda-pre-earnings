## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), my objective was to identify material, non-consensus information regarding the pricing and demand of H100, H200, and GB200 GPUs and rack-level systems, particularly any evidence of quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) price changes. The research focused on web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025).

While direct "leaked OEM/reseller quotation sheets" were not explicitly found, the search yielded several reports from industry analysts, cloud providers, and tech publications that provide specific pricing estimates, demand trends, and potential shipment challenges for NVIDIA's high-end data center GPUs. This information, particularly regarding the softening demand for older-generation Hopper chips and the ramp-up complexities of Blackwell, offers non-consensus insights likely to impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

### Key Findings and Analysis:

The overall sentiment suggests a nuanced picture: while demand for NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture (GB200) remains strong, its ramp-up is facing challenges, and the older Hopper generation (H100/H200) is experiencing some pricing pressure, particularly in cloud rental markets. This dynamic could lead to a mix of strong revenue from new products but potentially lower average selling prices (ASPs) for older ones, and a cautious outlook on the pace of Blackwell's contribution.

Here are the extracted findings:

---

**Finding 1: Softening H100 Cloud Pricing and Waning Hopper Demand**

*   **Snippet:** "Cloud pricing for H100 GPUs has seen significant decreases throughout 2025, with rates dropping from historical highs of $8 per hour to a more competitive range of $2.85-$3.50. This price reduction can be attributed to: Increased market supply. More datacenter providers entering the space. Improved availability of H100 units. Growing competition among cloud providers."
*   **Date:** April 12, 2025 (While the article is from April, it discusses trends "throughout 2025" and "current market data as of early 2025," making it relevant for the Q2 FY2026 period. The article itself was likely updated or published around mid-2025, as it states "We're midway through 2025".)
*   **Source:** Jarvislabs.ai Docs, Cyfuture Cloud (for context on H100 pricing)
*   **Impact:** High. A significant drop in H100 cloud rental rates suggests increased supply, greater competition, or softening demand for the Hopper generation. This could translate to lower ASPs for H100s sold directly to OEMs/resellers or impact NVIDIA's data center revenue if cloud providers negotiate lower bulk purchase prices.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While a general understanding of product cycles exists, the magnitude and specific reasons for the H100 cloud price drops, coupled with "waning Hopper generation demand," might not be fully priced into consensus estimates.

---

**Finding 2: H200 Pricing Remains Premium Despite Some Cloud Price Adjustments**

*   **Snippet:** "The NVIDIA H200 chip's estimated cost is around $32,000 per unit, depending on configurations and bulk purchasing terms. This price reflects its advanced performance capabilities and increased memory capacity, making it a cost-effective option compared to its predecessor, the H100."
*   **Snippet:** "Channel quotes put MSRP between $40 k and $55 k per GPU, and an 8-GPU HGX server retails north of $400 k."
*   **Snippet:** "H200 premiums remain steep. Even after AWS's June price cut, the cheapest hyperscaler H200 hour is >5 × Thunder Compute's A100."
*   **Date:** Undated (likely Q2/Q3 2025), May 12, 2025, August 1, 2025
*   **Source:** TRG Datacenters, Jarvislabs.ai Docs, Thunder Compute Blog
*   **Impact:** Medium. While H100 prices are dropping, H200 maintains a premium. The mention of an "AWS's June price cut" for H200 suggests some QoQ adjustment, but the overall "steep" premium indicates strong demand for its enhanced capabilities. This could partially offset H100 price erosion but highlights a potential for future price competition as supply increases.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that H200 is more expensive, but specific price ranges from channel quotes and the mention of recent cloud price cuts might be overlooked details.

**Finding 3: GB200 NVL72 Rack Pricing and Analyst Shipment Expectations**

*   **Snippet:** "The GB200 NVL72 is a single-rack, exascale AI computer designed for large-scale enterprise and hyperscale AI applications. Each unit includes 72 GPUs and comes with a hefty price tag of $3 million. Shipments began in February 2025, and this earnings report marks the first quarter where Nvidia's revenue includes sales from this new machine."
*   **Snippet:** "If Jensen Huang says we are going to deliver 10,000 units in Q2, the street will be very impressed”. That's a big doable number; 10,000 is $30 billion on a $3 million product. I think they are going to do less than 5,000."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** TECHi
*   **Impact:** High. The $3 million price tag for the GB200 NVL72 rack is a significant revenue driver. The analyst's expectation of "less than 5,000" units shipped in Q2 FY2026, compared to a "very impressed" street expectation of 10,000 units, represents a potential downside surprise for revenue if NVIDIA's actual shipments fall short of the higher end of analyst speculation.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the GB200's high price is known, specific analyst estimates for Q2 shipment volumes and the potential for a significant miss against optimistic "street" expectations could be non-consensus.

**Finding 4: Potential GB200 Shipment Delays Due to Advanced Design**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's new GB200 rackmount AI and HPC servers will be mass-produced in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2025, and shipments are expected to peak. A consulting firm based in Taiwan has stated that “concerns have arisen that delays in obtaining parts and shipping systems may occur due to the GB200's advanced design requirements.”"
*   **Date:** June 15, 2025
*   **Source:** moomoo Community (citing a Taiwan-based consulting firm and TrendForce)
*   **Impact:** High. Any delays in GB200 shipments directly impact revenue recognition and could lead to a downward revision of forward-looking guidance. The "advanced design requirements" and "delays in obtaining parts" point to supply chain complexities that could persist beyond Q2 FY2026.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the complexity of new product ramps is generally understood, specific concerns about "delays in obtaining parts and shipping systems" for GB200 due to its advanced design are likely not fully factored into market expectations.

**Finding 5: Announcement of GB300 (Blackwell Ultra) Could Impact GB200 Demand**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GB300 features 20,480 CUDA cores, 288GB HB3E memory and PCIe Gen6. Compared with GB200, GB300 raises SMs from 144 to 160 and moves from 192 GB to 288 GB of HBM3E using 12-Hi stacks. PCIe steps up from Gen5 ×16 (128 GB/s) to Gen6 ×16 (256 GB/s). TGP rises from 1,200W to 1,400W."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025
*   **Source:** VideoCardz.com
*   **Impact:** Medium. The announcement of a more powerful "Blackwell Ultra GB300" so close to the earnings report, even if it's a future product, could create a "wait-and-see" effect among some customers, potentially impacting the immediate demand or future order book for the GB200. It also signals a rapid product refresh cycle, which can be a double-edged sword.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA's innovation is expected, the timing and detailed specifications of a next-generation product (GB300) being revealed right before earnings could be a non-consensus factor influencing investor sentiment or future guidance.
