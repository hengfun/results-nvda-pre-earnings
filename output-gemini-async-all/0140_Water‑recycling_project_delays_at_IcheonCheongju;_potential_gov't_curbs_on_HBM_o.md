## Analysis

**Pre-Earnings Research Analysis: NVIDIA (NVDA) - Q2 FY2026**

As NVIDIA approaches its Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025, a review of recent, non-consensus information reveals several potential factors that could impact its HBM supply chain and, consequently, its forward-looking guidance. While direct confirmation of "water-recycling project delays at Icheon/Cheongju" or "potential government curbs on HBM output in droughts" remains elusive in recent reports, the broader context points to increasing water-related risks for semiconductor production in South Korea. More immediately, a significant, potentially overlooked, supply chain disruption involving a key HBM supplier has emerged.

Recent reports from late August 2025 indicate that South Korea is grappling with a severe drought, with "water shortages looming" and traditional rain rituals being conducted in Gangneung due to the "worst drought in decades." Although these reports do not explicitly link the drought to specific HBM production facilities in Icheon or Cheongju, the general environmental stress in a highly water-intensive manufacturing region like South Korea creates a heightened risk for semiconductor operations, including those of SK Hynix, a major HBM supplier to NVIDIA.

Adding to the long-term risk, a July 2025 PwC report highlights that climate change, particularly drought, poses a growing threat to global semiconductor production by impacting the supply of critical materials such as copper, which requires a stable water supply for extraction. Glenn Burm, head of PwC's global semiconductor division in South Korea, underscored the industry's increasing dependence on copper for AI developments and the necessity for companies to enhance water supply management and diversify supply chains. This systemic vulnerability could be exacerbated by current drought conditions, potentially affecting the broader semiconductor ecosystem that supports HBM production.

Perhaps the most material and non-consensus finding is a reported dispute between SK Hynix and its equipment supplier, Hanmi. According to an August 2025 SemiAnalysis report, Hanmi allegedly withdrew its field service teams from SK Hynix fabs in early April 2025. This action could severely impede SK Hynix's ability to ship its HBM products within weeks or months, as critical equipment would lack necessary servicing. Given SK Hynix's prominent role as an HBM supplier to NVIDIA, any prolonged disruption to their production due to equipment issues would have a direct and significant impact on NVIDIA's HBM procurement and, by extension, its ability to meet demand for AI accelerators. This specific operational challenge is likely not widely factored into current market expectations.

Furthermore, an August 2025 report from Project nGene.org mentions that utilization rates at SK Hynix's Icheon and Cheongju facilities "may fall if U.S. customers divert orders in anticipation of the Indiana packaging facility." While this potential decline in utilization is attributed to customer strategy rather than water issues, it still points to possible production adjustments at key HBM sites, which could indirectly affect HBM availability for NVIDIA.

In summary, while direct evidence of water-recycling project delays or government-imposed HBM output curbs due to drought remains unconfirmed, the ongoing drought in South Korea and the broader climate-related vulnerabilities of the semiconductor industry present an underlying, albeit less immediate, risk. The reported SK Hynix-Hanmi dispute, however, represents a more immediate and potentially significant non-consensus supply chain risk that could directly impact NVIDIA's HBM supply and, consequently, its upcoming earnings and guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

**Finding 1:**
- **Snippet:** "Heat Wave Drives Millions to Resorts, But Water Shortages Loom. August 25, 2025 | 0 Comments. Gangneung to Hold Traditional Rain Ritual Amid Worst Drought in Decades. August 21, 2025 | 0 Comments."
- **Date:** August 21, 2025, and August 25, 2025
- **Source:** Korea Bizwire, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFAWGy7LOsQgTe5a-WHt0lwTazFkfFn85viIeifyuL--2EE7NYmk2S4biBNdM3B6wpuMS3OsLTvIZ1Z7QpI4oCdIxg7rgfOqnxwtW9qfnV7qPBiNoKkZnYax2e_o-h1Bj9_vGlCR8BWnQhJrx76wkdY3bzzdVfHtp1Cjlw8OY7To249a0V2DRreudjMgkGjE5LkBgc21kMa9BShbgOoDk=
- **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: These recent reports indicate a severe and ongoing drought in South Korea. While not explicitly mentioning HBM production or specific facilities, semiconductor manufacturing, including HBM, is highly water-intensive. Widespread water shortages could lead to government-imposed restrictions or operational difficulties for fabs, including SK Hynix's facilities in Icheon and Cheongju, thereby impacting NVIDIA's HBM supply.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. General drought conditions might be known locally, but their specific implications for HBM production and potential government intervention are likely not widely factored into NVIDIA's earnings expectations.

**Finding 2:**
- **Snippet:** "The dispute reached a fever pitch in early April when Hanmi pulled its field service teams out of SK Hynix fabs. Without service, it would be months if not weeks before Hynix was unable to ship its marquee products. Longer-term it would threaten the entire accelerator supply chain as Micron and Samsung would not quickly be able to fill the capacity void."
- **Date:** August 12, 2025 (article published date, dispute in early April)
- **Source:** SemiAnalysis, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG7MC7XZ57cwbzfiDaY-_H4bDEz5HKti-jgF9BoXrXKZNoMwpv0fOdjn_laecE2MDQFU5ZrjKCjavoaV-1qqss0EfBt0RjanIQkWFxKS8zRF4DSgoGc6h9MVv097SXGv-XYGjH2r2urdLFHpv9juLBkne9t5TsGGcwk1PrmO4nQ3icS9-9ULZCL1oL4t9y_o9Uo1w=
- **Impact:** High. Reasoning: This is a direct, non-consensus report of a significant supply chain disruption for SK Hynix, a primary HBM supplier to NVIDIA. The withdrawal of field service teams from a critical equipment supplier (Hanmi) could severely impact HBM production yields and output, directly affecting NVIDIA's ability to procure HBM for its AI accelerators. The timing (early April dispute, article in August) suggests this issue could be ongoing or have lingering effects.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This specific dispute and its potential impact on SK Hynix's HBM output are highly specific and likely not widely known or factored into analyst models.

**Finding 3:**
- **Snippet:** "According to PwC's analysis, by 2035, approximately 32% of global semiconductor production is expected to rely on a copper supply that is vulnerable to disruption due to climate change. If greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, that share is projected to rise to 58% by 2050. ... Glenn Burm, global semiconductors leader at PwC South Korea, emphasised the importance of semiconductors in modern technology and how the industry is becoming increasingly dependent on copper, particularly to boost AI developments."
- **Date:** July 8, 2025
- **Source:** Techzine / PwC report, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGd5A9QWAfed4g5WZLwjpzi3ABju6slSUqe8jPmU3xnn9t8TTQtwtSQJCsNB--zSKgZ9xL58txKjN-WgkHxo2vm3azxLq269A9nbB21dd0mC7vynmUbadHxnjgCJ-GbSxcwm32ttIBIuTxpfd_NSQU3UwIREuw4Qu1vTm_TWOs9UnJR4yIlYzjp9HWmljMjVauhuqIDNwir7PDyuAc0u7CDBuGBJFZXLVT9H8c0gC46
- **Impact:** Medium. Reasoning: While a longer-term projection (by 2035), this report highlights a fundamental and growing vulnerability of the semiconductor industry, including HBM production, to climate change and water scarcity impacting critical material (copper) supply. The quote from PwC's South Korea leader makes it relevant to the region. This adds to the overall risk profile for NVIDIA's supply chain, especially in the context of current drought conditions.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known in a general sense, but the specific percentage and the emphasis on copper's vulnerability in South Korea might be overlooked in short-term earnings models.

**Finding 4:**
- **Snippet:** "Icheon & Cheongju (SK Hynix) — Utilization rates may fall if U.S. customers divert orders in anticipation of the Indiana packaging facility, pressing overtime and temporary staffing levels. Production adjustments would likely affect subcontracting hours first."
- **Date:** August 7, 2025
- **Source:** Project nGene.org, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFE24hd3o79AQdOq7fVItWqG_UEaDI3FJIHOCSlkUZJ3lMolsmjqMxrghKguBUBCSdrjDnaOaZrxN66AdQljTjg98z6uPxX69z1ySTRcRxtWSMqlfiDhebTpPQIQ9Q=
- **Impact:** Low to Medium. Reasoning: This snippet directly mentions SK Hynix's Icheon & Cheongju facilities. While the reason for potential fall in utilization rates is attributed to U.S. customer diversion (related to tariffs/new facilities, not water), it still points to potential production adjustments at these key HBM sites. This could indirectly affect HBM availability, though the primary driver isn't the water issue.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific impact of U.S. customer diversion on SK Hynix's Icheon/Cheongju utilization rates is likely not a widely discussed factor for NVIDIA's immediate earnings.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding water issues impacting HBM production.
*   **Gaps:** The primary gap is the lack of explicit, recent (within 3 months) confirmation of "water-recycling project delays at Icheon/Cheongju" or "potential gov't curbs on HBM output in droughts" directly impacting HBM production. While general drought conditions are present, and the industry is vulnerable, specific actions or delays directly attributable to water scarcity affecting HBM output are not explicitly reported in the search results.
