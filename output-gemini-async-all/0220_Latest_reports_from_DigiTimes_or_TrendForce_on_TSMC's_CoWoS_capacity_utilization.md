## Analysis

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Recent reports from DigiTimes, published on August 5th and 7th, 2025, reveal a significant and potentially non-consensus development regarding TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging capacity. Contrary to widespread market expectations and earlier reports that consistently highlighted CoWoS as a severe bottleneck with demand outpacing supply, TSMC's CoWoS lines are reportedly operating at only 60% capacity utilization. This "supply-demand mismatch" has reportedly caused confusion within the supply chain.

This finding is highly material for NVIDIA, as over half of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is typically allocated to NVIDIA for its high-performance AI GPUs. If this 60% utilization rate is accurate and reflects a slowdown in NVIDIA's wafer starts or a significant overestimation of immediate demand by TSMC, it could negatively impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings or, more likely, its forward-looking guidance. Supply chain insiders suggest the lower utilization could stem from TSMC's rapid capacity expansion outpacing actual demand or "possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients." This implies that NVIDIA might have adjusted its orders, or TSMC built capacity faster than NVIDIA could fill it in the short term.

This information stands in stark contrast to previous reports from June and July 2025, which consistently highlighted CoWoS as a critical bottleneck, with demand expected to keep capacity at full stretch throughout 2025. While long-term projections still indicate aggressive CoWoS capacity growth through 2026 (reaching 65,000-75,000 units by end-2025 and 100,000 by end-2026), the immediate underutilization is a non-consensus data point. Another potential underlying factor, though not directly linked to the 60% utilization in the same reports, is a persistent shortage of specialized low-CTE glass cloth, a key material for CoWoS substrates. Japan's Nittobo controls approximately 80% of this market, and new capacity is not expected until 2027, potentially affecting the *effective* output or efficiency of CoWoS.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA's upcoming Rubin platform, slated for trial production in October 2025 and mass production in Q2 2026, is expected to heavily utilize CoWoS, suggesting that any current softness might be temporary or related to a transition period. However, for the immediate earnings report, the reported 60% CoWoS utilization presents a potential downside risk or at least a significant shift in the supply-demand dynamics previously understood.

**Structured Findings:**

-   **Snippet:** "Reports have emerged that TSMC's advanced packaging technology, CoWoS, is operating at only 60% capacity utilization. Such a supply-demand mismatch has confused the supply chain."
    -   **Date:** August 5, 2025

    -   **Impact:** High (95) - This is a direct, recent, and significant deviation from market expectations of tight CoWoS supply, directly impacting NVIDIA's ability to procure packaged GPUs. Lower utilization could imply lower demand from key customers like NVIDIA or an oversupply of packaging capacity relative to immediate needs.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Previous consensus (June-July 2025) indicated CoWoS was a major bottleneck and operating at full capacity. This 60% figure is a strong non-consensus data point.

-   **Snippet:** "Supply chain insiders suggest this situation may stem from TSMC's rapid expansion outpacing actual demand or possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients."

    -   **Impact:** High (90) - Provides potential reasons for the 60% utilization, directly implicating NVIDIA's wafer starts. If NVIDIA has adjusted orders downwards, it directly impacts their revenue and guidance.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific mention of "short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia" is non-consensus, as the prevailing narrative has been insatiable demand.

-   **Snippet:** "Previous estimates indicate that TSMC(2330.TW) has accelerated CoWoS packaging capacity expansion in recent years, with over half of this capacity allocated to Nvidia."
    -   **Date:** August 5, 2025

    -   **Impact:** Medium (70) - Establishes the direct link and high dependency of NVIDIA on TSMC's CoWoS capacity, making the 60% utilization highly relevant.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. NVIDIA's reliance on TSMC's CoWoS for its high-end AI GPUs is a well-established fact.

-   **Snippet:** "Monthly capacity is projected to reach between 65,000 and 75,000 units by the end of 2025, rising to around 100,000 units by the end of 2026."

    -   **Impact:** Medium (60) - While current utilization is low, the aggressive long-term capacity expansion plans suggest that the current situation might be a short-term blip rather than a fundamental shift in demand outlook. This could temper the negative impact of the 60% utilization if the market believes demand will catch up.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. TSMC's aggressive CoWoS expansion plans have been a consistent theme in industry reports.

-   **Snippet:** "TrendForce reports TSMC's CoWoS capacity will hit ≈75,000 wafers / month in 2025, nearly doubling 2024's flow — exactly the scale-out the essay demands. Memory bottleneck. With logic and CoWoS on track, HBM is now the pinch-point; SK Hynix says its 2025 HBM output is “almost sold out,” confirming III-a's warning that high-bandwidth memory, not lithography, will be the gating factor."

    -   **Impact:** Medium (65) - This highlights a contradiction with the August 5th DigiTimes report. It also suggests that even if CoWoS capacity is available, HBM could be the *new* bottleneck, which would still constrain NVIDIA's ability to ship complete AI GPUs.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The HBM bottleneck has been discussed, but the idea of CoWoS being "on track" contradicts the more recent 60% utilization report.

-   **Snippet:** "If TrendForce's timing holds, 2025 will be a transition year where capacity tightness persists, with step-ups in the back half as new CoWoS lines and substrate investments come online."

    -   **Impact:** Medium (60) - This TrendForce view, while recent, still suggests "capacity tightness" for 2025, which conflicts with the DigiTimes 60% utilization report. It implies that any current softness might be temporary, with a ramp-up expected in H2 2025.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Contradictory. This view of persistent tightness contradicts the 60% utilization reported by DigiTimes.

-   **Snippet:** "The Rubin platform will enter trial production at TSMC in October, with mass production expected in 2Q26... Expect heavy use of CoWoS variants for GPU and switch dies and SoIC stacking for tighter integration where latency matters."

    -   **Impact:** Low (40) for Q2 FY2026 earnings, High for future guidance (80) - While not directly impacting the current quarter, this confirms strong future demand for CoWoS from NVIDIA, which could be a positive for forward guidance, potentially offsetting concerns about current underutilization.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. NVIDIA's roadmap and reliance on advanced packaging for future platforms are generally understood.

-   **Snippet:** "Japan is the bottleneck behind the bottleneck... Nittobo controls over 80% of the global high-grade glass cloth market... Nittobo's new capacity won't come online until 2027."

    -   **Impact:** Medium (75) - This highlights a critical, often overlooked, supply chain constraint for CoWoS substrates. Even if CoWoS packaging lines are not fully utilized, a shortage of this base material could limit *effective* output or increase costs, indirectly impacting NVIDIA.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general supply chain issues are known, the specific bottleneck of Nittobo's glass cloth and its long lead time for new capacity is likely non-consensus.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The most significant contradiction is between the DigiTimes report of 60% CoWoS capacity utilization (August 5, 2025) and earlier reports (June-July 2025) from TrendForce and other sources that consistently described CoWoS as a bottleneck operating at full capacity with demand outpacing supply.
*   **Gap:** While the DigiTimes report mentions "possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients" as a reason for the lower utilization, it lacks specific details on the magnitude or duration of these adjustments for NVIDIA. This is crucial for a precise assessment of the impact on NVIDIA's financials.
*   **Gap:** The direct causal link between the reported 60% CoWoS utilization and the glass cloth shortage is not explicitly established in the DigiTimes articles about utilization. It's unclear if the glass cloth shortage is a contributing factor to the lower utilization or if the two issues are separate.
