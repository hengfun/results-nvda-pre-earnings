## Analysis

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Recent reports from Taiwan's trade press paint a nuanced picture regarding TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, a crucial element for NVIDIA's high-performance AI GPUs. While TSMC is aggressively expanding its CoWoS capacity, with projections reaching 65,000-75,000 units per month by the end of 2025 and up to 100,000 units by the end of 2026, a significant and potentially non-consensus finding suggests that current CoWoS capacity utilization is only around 60%.

This reported underutilization, which has "confused the supply chain," could stem from TSMC's rapid expansion outpacing immediate demand or "possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients." Furthermore, there is evidence of "restrained spending on CoWoS equipment procurement behind the scenes" and a potential "deceleration in new orders" for advanced packaging suppliers after existing order books are fulfilled. This sentiment is corroborated by reports of SK Hynix signaling "slowing demand for TCB equipment" in the second half of 2025, which are essential for advanced packaging.

Despite these utilization concerns, NVIDIA is projected to remain the dominant customer, with "over half" of TSMC's CoWoS capacity allocated to it, potentially increasing to "over 60% of TSMC's CoWoS capacity in 2026."

The key takeaway for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings is the potential for a short-term slowdown in CoWoS demand or adjustments in NVIDIA's own wafer starts, which could impact its Q2 FY2026 results or, more likely, its forward-looking guidance. While long-term AI demand remains strong, the immediate supply chain signals suggest a possible temporary softening in the advanced packaging segment. This information, particularly the 60% utilization rate and the "short-term adjustments" from clients, appears to be non-consensus and could lead to market surprise if not adequately addressed by NVIDIA.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1:**

*   **Snippet:** "Reports have emerged that TSMC's advanced packaging technology, CoWoS, is operating at only 60% capacity utilization. Such a supply-demand mismatch has confused the supply chain."
*   **Date:** August 5, 2025
*   **Source:** DigiTimes, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFdqtkh2mRtTViY50Jynr5YVJN1wGABkcagreN-tHGun-GbSAVk3RZ-i6_j7pnf_gfZDIk2g0zuTjmXF76r7R6ZvrJHyAVk_AzQ6KpKoaoqSfZbv9pqSaxVqzDRZ7OyAXwdGgRIHeH2A-CBDjwHRHW6verwXS7wFRoH9qaSUW4A3DalPKv6ZHmWECejtIDdSHQY1K5j](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFdqtkh2mRtTViY50Jynr5YVJN1wGABkcagreN-tHGun-GbSAVk3RZ-i6_j7pnf_gfZDIk2g0zuTjmXF76r7R6ZvrJHyAVk_AzQ6KpKoaoqSfZbv9pqSaxVqzDRZ7OyAXwdGgRIHeH2A-CBDjwHRHW6verwXS7wFRoH9qaSUW4A3DalPKv6ZHmWECejtIDdSHQY1K5j)
*   **Impact:** High. This suggests a potential oversupply or a temporary slowdown in demand for CoWoS packaging, which is critical for NVIDIA's AI GPUs. If NVIDIA is a significant contributor to this "short-term adjustment in wafer starts," it could directly impact their revenue and guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market generally assumes insatiable demand for CoWoS and high utilization given the AI boom. This 60% utilization figure is a strong non-consensus indicator.

**Finding 2:**

*   **Snippet:** "Supply chain insiders suggest this situation may stem from TSMC's rapid expansion outpacing actual demand or possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients. While AI demand remains strong and TSMC maintains a positive long-term outlook on AI growth, there is evidence of restrained spending on CoWoS equipment procurement behind the scenes. After fulfilling existing order books, which typically cover six months to a year, advanced packaging suppliers may see a deceleration in new orders."
*   **Date:** August 5, 2025
*   **Source:** DigiTimes, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFdqtkh2mRtTViY50Jynr5YVJN1wGABkcagreN-tHGun-GbSAVk3RZ-i6_j7pnf_gfZDIk2g0zuTjmXF76r7R6ZvrJHyAVk_AzQ6KpKoaoqSfZbv9pqSaxVqzDRZ7OyAXwdGgRIHeH2A-CBDjwHRHW6verwXS7wFRoH9qaSUW4A3DalPKv6ZHmWECejtIDdSHQY1K5j](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFdqtkh2mRtTViY50Jynr5YVJN1wGABkcagreN-tHGun-GbSAVk3RZ-i6_j7pnf_gfZDIk2g0zuTjmXF76r7R6ZvrJHyAVk_AzQ6KpKoaoqSfZbv9pqSaxVqzDRZ7OyAXwdGgRIHeH2A-CBDjwHRHW6verwXS7wFRoH9qaSUW4A3DalPKv6ZHmWECejtIDdSHQY1K5j)
*   **Impact:** High. This directly implicates NVIDIA as a potential source of "short-term adjustments in wafer starts." "Restrained spending on CoWoS equipment procurement" and "deceleration in new orders" suggest a broader, albeit potentially temporary, softening in the advanced packaging supply chain, which could impact NVIDIA's ability to secure future capacity or signal a slowdown in their own demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market's focus is on NVIDIA's strong demand, not potential short-term adjustments or a broader slowdown in equipment orders.

**Finding 3:**

*   **Snippet:** "SK Hynix signals slowing demand for TCB equipment, putting Hanmi at risk... The market for thermo-compression bonders, or TCB, has surged on the back of booming demand for AI. But signals out of South Korea now show signs of a slowdown. New orders in the second half of 2025 are expected to fall short of forecasts..."

*   **Impact:** Medium-High. TCB equipment is crucial for advanced packaging like CoWoS. A slowdown in demand for this equipment from a key memory supplier like SK Hynix (which supplies HBM to NVIDIA) reinforces the concerns about a potential softening in the advanced packaging supply chain, aligning with the CoWoS utilization issues. This could indirectly affect NVIDIA's ability to scale production or signal a broader industry trend.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While specific to TCB equipment, this points to a potential broader slowdown in the AI supply chain's expansion, which is not widely discussed in the context of NVIDIA's seemingly insatiable demand.

**Finding 4:**

*   **Snippet:** "Previous estimates indicate that TSMC(2330.TW) has accelerated CoWoS packaging capacity expansion in recent years, with over half of this capacity allocated to Nvidia. Other ASIC chip customers like AMD have also increased wafer starts. Monthly capacity is projected to reach between 65,000 and 75,000 units by the end of 2025, rising to around 100,000 units by the end of 2026."
*   **Date:** August 5, 2025

*   **Impact:** Medium. This provides specific capacity expansion numbers and confirms NVIDIA's significant allocation. While the expansion itself is known, the precise figures and NVIDIA's continued dominance are material for understanding their supply chain leverage.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that TSMC is expanding CoWoS and NVIDIA is a major customer, but the specific monthly capacity projections and the "over half" allocation are more granular details.

**Finding 5:**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia to dominate AI semiconductor market with over 60% of TSMC's CoWoS capacity in 2026."
*   **Date:** August 19, 2025
*   **Source:** DigiTimes Asia, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGrEELokgA99_E7f3Ph1WZhGuJGF6Gv4BAgsHKEo7llSOQRDMsFFxhq19ccaZCqcSPry4pJQBZkIfKMHYW1H737gByds4d4WlMSYsz_nAiIFVf7Y7XOeir9JH3dTwFam_-y3S4IfCx69QMxlKrxM24I-39U=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGrEELokgA99_E7f3Ph1WZhGuJGF6Gv4BAgsHKEo7llSOQRDMsFFxhq19ccaZCqcSPry4pJQBZkIfKMHYW1H737gByds4d4WlMSYsz_nAiIFVf7Y7XOeir9JH3dTwFam_-y3S4IfCx69QMxlKrxM24I-39U=)
*   **Impact:** Medium. This reinforces NVIDIA's strong position in securing advanced packaging capacity for the longer term. While positive for NVIDIA's future, the immediate impact on Q2 FY2026 earnings is less direct than the utilization concerns.
*   **Consensus Check:** Generally known that NVIDIA is a dominant customer, but the specific "over 60% in 2026" is a more precise forward-looking allocation estimate.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The reported 60% CoWoS capacity utilization stands in contrast to the aggressive capacity expansion plans and the general market perception of overwhelming AI demand. This suggests a potential disconnect between planned capacity and immediate demand/utilization.
*   **Gap:** While NVIDIA's percentage allocation of CoWoS capacity is mentioned (over 50%, potentially over 60% by 2026), specific *monthly* unit allocations for NVIDIA are not provided. This makes it difficult to precisely quantify the impact of any "short-term adjustments in wafer starts" on NVIDIA's specific volumes. The exact reasons for "short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients" are also not detailed.
