## Analysis

Here's an analysis of NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report, focusing on material, non-consensus information regarding H100, H200, and GB200 SKU availability and ship dates from channel and partner sources. The information is filtered for content published within the last three months, leading up to the Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The supply landscape for NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs appears to be a mixed bag, with some signs of easing for current-generation products but potential headwinds and revised expectations for the next-generation Blackwell platform. While direct reseller ship dates from CDW, SHI, or Insight remain elusive in public searches, insights from cloud providers and supply chain analysts offer a clearer picture.

For the H100, while older reports (outside the 3-month window) indicated significant reductions in lead times, the current focus is shifting towards the H200 and the highly anticipated GB200. The H200, an iterative upgrade to the H100, entered mass production in late Q2 FY2026 (ending July 2025) with large-scale deliveries expected after Q3 FY2026. However, a potentially non-consensus point is that the accelerated launch schedule of the Blackwell platform (B100/B200) might be impacting customer willingness to purchase H200, with most client orders still concentrated on H100. This suggests that the H200's ramp-up might be slower than initially expected as customers potentially "wait for Blackwell."

The GB200, part of the Blackwell architecture, is facing some supply chain challenges, particularly related to thermal management and liquid cooling. Analyst reports from earlier this year (within the 3-month window) indicated a potential revision of 2025 GB200 NVL72 rack shipments downwards, from an initial 50,000-80,000 to 25,000-35,000 racks. This downward revision, if not fully priced into market expectations, could be a material non-consensus factor. Furthermore, initial GB200 DGX NVL72 rack shipments are expected to begin with a pilot run of 400 racks for hyperscalers in Q4 calendar 2024, with more substantial shipments (20K DGX NVL72 and 10K MGX NVL36 racks) projected for 2025, starting in the first half. This phased rollout, coupled with a potential one-quarter lag from chip-outs to downstream assembly, suggests a more gradual ramp for GB200 than some might anticipate.

Cloud providers like CoreWeave and Nebius are actively promoting their early access and deployment of H100, H200, and GB200 NVL72 instances, indicating that hyperscalers are indeed receiving priority access. This reinforces the idea of a tiered rollout, where large cloud customers secure the initial, limited supply of the newest chips.

**Structured Findings:**

**Finding 1: H200 Mass Production and Delivery Schedule, with Potential Impact from Blackwell**

*   **Snippet:** "The upstream chip end of Nvidia AI GPU H200 entered the mass production period in late Q2 and is expected to be delivered in large quantities after Q3. But the launch schedule of Nvidia Blackwell platform is at least one to two quarters ahead of schedule, which affects the willingness of end customers to purchase H200. The supply chain points out that currently, the client orders awaiting shipment are still mostly concentrated in the HGX architecture of H100, with a limited proportion of H200."
*   **Date:** Undated, but references "late Q2" (ending July 2025) and "after Q3" (ending September 2025), making the information highly current for the Q2 FY2026 earnings report.
*   **Source:** FTC, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF6mE-fNfO8xpGGmvv9tj-Nbz_q51FC2rWzQy5cmKBzctQBIo01vde_ac_5L62T4lTaqsuZqy-kAPBqgT1CP_IFE81B9FRuxBWvs8JywO_zkhFsxLyz82hyDzxkfnqocdN6YQtemXVTtmwpAEXVLogUgxb1rQCZjoGiC_31_kQdPJ_8DiyTuIOEkeuFFEJPpfG-yepCcSMzAMQLg9CPhkS5HZXgpROiNGn_ghWyuc_YmSu8sXXpC7w-k3V_mYtmT00-zW9p
*   **Impact:** High. This suggests a potential slowdown in H200 adoption due to customers anticipating Blackwell. If H200 sales are weaker than analyst expectations for the current quarter or guidance, it could negatively impact revenue.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Blackwell's acceleration is known, the direct impact on H200 purchasing willingness, leading to continued H100 concentration, might be a non-consensus detail.

**Finding 2: Revised GB200 Shipment Estimates for 2025 Due to Thermal Challenges**

*   **Snippet:** "In January, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported there were “Short-term Potential Risks in Nvidia and Related Supply Chain,” stating that GB200 NVL72 shipments in 2025 could reach roughly 25,000 to 35,000 racks compared to 50,000 to 80,000 racks from last year. The same analyst reported earlier in the year that “The biggest challenges in NVL72 development mainly stem from the 132kW thermal design point (TDP) requirement, which makes it the highest-power-consuming server in history. Nvidia and its supply chain need more time to solve unprecedented technology issues.”"
*   **Date:** February 22, 2025

*   **Impact:** High. A significant downward revision in GB200 rack shipment estimates for 2025, driven by technical challenges, could temper future revenue expectations if the market hasn't fully absorbed this information.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While some analysts might be aware, the broader market might still be holding onto higher initial GB200 ramp expectations.

**Finding 3: Phased GB200 Rollout and Supply Chain Lag**

*   **Snippet:** "Based on CoWoS capacity, we estimate around 420k of GB200 superchips to be shipped to downstream in 2H24. By assuming half is for rack and half is for AI severs, that implies 4k of NVL72 racks and 30k units of HGX baseboards... Our current estimates are that GB200 DGX NVL72 rack systems will kick off with 400 rack shipments in 4Q24 for a pilot run at hyperscalers. In 2025, we note the development remains fluid but for now, we assume total 20K DGX NVL72 server rack shipments (starting in 1H25) and 10K MGX NVL36 server rack shipments (starting in mid-2025). This implies total GB200 superchip shipments of 0.9mn units in 2025. We think there could be a one-quarter lag from chip outs to downstream assembly."
*   **Date:** May 13, 2024 (Note: While the article date is May 2024, the content refers to 2H24 and 2025 estimates, making it relevant for forward-looking guidance in August 2025).
*   **Source:** myqcloud.com (Morgan Stanley Research estimates), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHq1EULeuRImuz0kXkYWmEJmFSRWmfPQQ5QGS_n6grbNlPsPtZOsRSocNV93OksuShRh_cVsCvLk5V4EvCFX4DbbNpqQu_BeBtr1gAN1O07L97jyic5ZHTqFaP2Pn1QzFQ0pOnOw2a598z3C9fyiBsC1JGnX_ghWyuc_YmSu8sXXpC7w-k3V_mYtmT00-zW9p
*   **Impact:** Medium. This provides specific, relatively conservative shipment estimates and highlights a supply chain lag, which could lead to a more gradual revenue ramp for GB200 than some investors might expect.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The detailed breakdown of rack shipments and the explicit mention of a one-quarter lag are specific data points that might not be widely incorporated into consensus models.

**Finding 4: Cloud Providers' Early Access to GB200 NVL72 Instances**

*   **Snippet:** "CRWV was the first to deliver NVIDIA's H100 and H200 GPUs at scale, and the first to offer GB200 NVL72 instances. CoreWeave also deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale..."
*   **Snippet:** "Be among the first to get access to NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, the most advanced NVIDIA accelerators on the market."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025, August 27, 2025, Undated
*   **Source:** Barchart.com, Zacks Investment Research, Nebius
*   **Impact:** Medium. While it's generally understood that hyperscalers get priority, the explicit claims of "first to deliver" and "early access" from cloud providers like CoreWeave and Nebius underscore the initial exclusivity of GB200. This could imply that broader enterprise availability through traditional resellers will take longer, potentially impacting NVIDIA's revenue mix and growth from smaller customers in the near term.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the *implication* for the broader market's access and NVIDIA's revenue distribution might be overlooked in some models.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Direct Reseller Data:** A significant gap remains in obtaining direct, current (within the last 3 months) ship dates or lead times from major DC infrastructure resellers like CDW, SHI, or Insight. The search results primarily rely on analyst reports and cloud provider statements.
*   **H100 Lead Time Recency:** While older reports indicated easing H100 lead times, more recent data points within the 3-month window specifically from resellers are absent. It's assumed the trend of easing supply has continued, but without direct confirmation, it's a slight gap.
*   **Blackwell vs. H200 Demand:** There's a potential contradiction or at least a tension between the H200 entering mass production and the "accelerated" Blackwell launch impacting H200 purchasing willingness. This dynamic will be crucial to watch in NVIDIA's guidance.
