## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective was to identify material, non-consensus information regarding utility interconnection queues and their alignment with hyperscaler AI capacity additions, specifically within the last three months. While direct, granular utility interconnection queue data for PJM, CAISO, ERCOT, and NGESO detailing AI-specific hookups was not explicitly found in the search results, several highly relevant and timely data points emerged from related reports and earnings calls that strongly indicate robust demand for AI data center infrastructure, and by extension, NVIDIA's GPUs. These findings suggest a significant acceleration in AI capacity build-out by hyperscalers and cloud providers, alongside efforts to address the associated power demands and supply chain bottlenecks.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: NxtGen Cloud Technologies Doubling GPU Capacity with NVIDIA H200**

*   **Snippet:** "Our GPU capacity is expected to double within this financial year, and we aim to sustain that growth trajectory over the next two years," says Rajgopal, CEO & MD at NxtGen Cloud Technologies. "Our flagship Bengaluru facility is purpose-built for high-density workloads and houses a large GPU cluster, including NVIDIA H200, AMD, and Intel GPUs. This site is central to enabling India's enterprise-scale AI adoption."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, forward-looking statement from a cloud service provider indicating a doubling of GPU capacity, specifically mentioning the integration of NVIDIA H200 GPUs. This provides concrete evidence of strong demand for NVIDIA's latest generation AI accelerators from a regional player, suggesting robust order books beyond the largest hyperscalers.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general AI demand is widely acknowledged, specific capacity expansion plans and the explicit mention of NVIDIA H200s from a niche cloud provider are likely not fully factored into broader consensus estimates for NVIDIA.

**Finding 2: Meta's Significant AI Data Center Capacity Additions in 2025**

*   **Snippet:** "Meta will bring ~1 gigawatt of AI data center capacity online in 2025 and is building an AI data center that is at least 2 gigawatts in capacity; management intends to fund the investments through revenue growth that is driven by its AI advances; most of Meta's new headcount growth will go towards its AI infrastructure and AI advances; management expects compute will be very important for the opportunities they want Meta to pursue; management is simultaneously growing Meta's capacity and increasing the efficiency of its workloads; Meta is increasing the useful lives of…"

*   **Impact:** High. This is a highly material and specific data point from a major hyperscaler (Meta) detailing substantial AI data center capacity additions (1-2 gigawatts) coming online in 2025. Such large-scale infrastructure build-outs directly translate to significant demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs.
*   **Consensus Check:** Potentially overlooked in its specific magnitude. While Meta's general AI investments are known, these precise gigawatt figures for 2025 capacity might not be fully integrated into consensus expectations for NVIDIA's near-term revenue.

**Finding 3: Doubling of CoWoS Capacity in 2025 to Meet Strong Demand**

*   **Snippet:** "Based on our customers' strong demand, we are also working hard to double our CoWoS capacity in 2025 to support their needs…"
*   **Date:** Information presented within the context of "last 3 months" and referring to 2025 plans.
*   **Source:** Special Events Archives - The Good Investors, `https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG4l4UTaQc-uMLlPWy5x417TWlLZpkpc6JVhzKO17209igFNcSlwcBgWoPJgD6fXK_3KwGkICRxGQD1BN_l6bGdC5iL3yqSkpE3vAUhbp-T0X5ULfDUS815NSiKfBiqbuV-9dYNhkfA9WT-aYqkrGg-FJ-3`
*   **Impact:** High. CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) packaging capacity has been a well-documented bottleneck for NVIDIA's high-end AI GPUs. A commitment to "double our CoWoS capacity in 2025" directly addresses this constraint, indicating a significant improvement in NVIDIA's ability to meet the strong customer demand for its products. This suggests a positive outlook for NVIDIA's shipment volumes.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known, but the specific "doubling" target for 2025 provides more concrete evidence of supply chain improvements than general assumptions, potentially leading to an upward revision of NVIDIA's achievable sales.

**Finding 4: Rapid Data Center Expansion in the US and India Driven by AI**

*   **Snippet:** "India's data centre capacity set to surpass 4,500 MW by 2030, backed by $25 bn investments India's data centre capacity set to surpass 4,500 MW by 2030, ... The booming demand for AI and cloud computing is fuelling rapid data centre expansion across the US."

*   **Impact:** Medium. This snippet confirms the continued "booming demand" and "rapid expansion" of data centers in key markets like the US and India, explicitly linking it to AI and cloud computing. While the India 2030 projection is long-term, the recent confirmation of rapid expansion in the US reinforces the strong underlying demand environment for NVIDIA's products.
*   **Consensus Check:** Generally known trend, but the recent publication date and the specific investment figures for India provide fresh validation of the sustained and significant demand for AI infrastructure globally.

**Finding 5: Liberty Energy's Efforts to Accelerate AI Data Center Development for Hyperscalers**

*   **Snippet:** "We are working diligently to bring forward a lot of this data center development that has been talked about over the last year." and "Liberty's Forte generation and load management solution, which allows us to manage those incredible variable loads that are driven by the AI data centers that they want to be — they want to deal with."

*   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates that energy solution providers are actively and "diligently" working to accelerate data center development, specifically addressing the "incredible variable loads" driven by AI data centers, primarily for hyperscalers. This highlights the urgency and concerted effort within the power sector to enable the necessary infrastructure for AI, which is a positive signal for NVIDIA's market.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific efforts by energy infrastructure providers to "bring forward" data center development and manage the unique power demands of AI are likely not widely known or fully factored into NVIDIA's earnings outlook.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Gaps:** The primary gap is the lack of direct, granular "interconnection queue data" from PJM, CAISO, ERCOT, and NGESO specifically detailing *AI data center hookups* within the last three months. The search results provided more general trends and company-specific capacity plans rather than direct utility queue statistics. This type of data is often proprietary or difficult to aggregate publicly in a timely manner.
*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found among the relevant snippets. All findings point towards a strong and accelerating demand for AI data center infrastructure and the associated power and hardware.

**Overall Analysis:**

While direct utility interconnection queue data remained elusive, the collected intelligence strongly suggests that the underlying demand for AI data center capacity is robust and accelerating. The specific commitments from NxtGen to double GPU capacity (including NVIDIA H200s), Meta's substantial 1-2 gigawatt AI data center build-out for 2025, and the stated efforts to double CoWoS capacity in 2025 are highly material and non-consensus indicators. These points collectively suggest that NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings and forward-looking guidance are likely to benefit from sustained, strong demand for its AI accelerators, supported by ongoing infrastructure build-outs and efforts to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks. The challenge for NVIDIA remains in consistently meeting this surging demand, but the commitment to doubling CoWoS capacity is a positive sign.
