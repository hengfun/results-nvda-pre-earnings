## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective was to find and extract material, non-consensus information regarding ABF film capacity updates from Ajinomoto, specifically concerning HBM substrates, and the risk of film rationing in Q4 FY2026 (quarter ending January 2026). The research focused on web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025).

Despite extensive searches, no direct, specific, and recent public information was found detailing Ajinomoto's ABF film capacity updates for HBM substrates or explicitly mentioning a risk of film rationing in Q4 FY2026. This type of highly specific supply chain information is often proprietary or only available through specialized, paid industry reports.

However, the research did uncover several material insights regarding the broader HBM supply chain, which is directly relevant to NVIDIA's performance and guidance, and where ABF film plays a critical, albeit often unstated, role. The extreme tightness in HBM supply suggests that any constraint in a foundational material like ABF film would have a significant, non-consensus impact.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

The current landscape for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is characterized by exceptionally strong demand driven by the AI boom, with key suppliers operating at full capacity. Micron, a major HBM producer, has reported that its HBM production capacity is completely sold out through calendar year 2025, with active discussions already underway for 2026 supply agreements. This indicates a severely constrained HBM market.

Furthermore, NVIDIA itself is actively pushing for accelerated HBM product launch dates, underscoring the critical nature of HBM availability for its next-generation AI accelerators. TSMC, a crucial manufacturing partner for NVIDIA, has also acknowledged "very tight capacity to support the AI demand," noting that both HBM and CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate, which utilizes ABF film) are significant constraints.

While direct evidence of Ajinomoto ABF film rationing was not found, the pervasive tightness in the HBM supply chain means that any disruption or constraint in ABF film, a critical component for HBM substrates, would exacerbate existing bottlenecks. The absence of public discussion around ABF film rationing, despite the known HBM constraints, could be interpreted as a non-consensus risk. If Ajinomoto, a dominant supplier of ABF film, faces unforeseen production issues or cannot scale fast enough to meet the escalating HBM demand, it could lead to an unpredicted bottleneck, impacting NVIDIA's ability to ship its high-demand AI GPUs in Q4 and beyond. This would be a material, non-consensus event for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings and forward guidance.

### Structured Findings:

**Finding 1: HBM Capacity Sold Out Through Calendar 2025 for Key Supplier**

*   **Snippet:** "Micron's entire quarterly revenue in Q2 was approximately $8.1 billion meaning HBM now is roughly 13% of total company revenue. This percentage is growing rapidly, and HBM carries significantly higher margins than traditional memory products. What gives me confidence in the sustainability of this growth is the capacity utilization picture. They have completely sold out their HBM production capacity through calendar 2025, and management hinted that they're already in active discussions with customers about 2026 supply agreements."

*   **Impact:** High. This indicates an extremely tight HBM market, which is a critical component for NVIDIA's AI GPUs. Any upstream material constraint, such as ABF film, would directly impact NVIDIA's ability to secure sufficient HBM, thereby affecting revenue and guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that HBM demand is high, but the specific detail of a major supplier being completely sold out through 2025 and already negotiating 2026 supply highlights the severity, which might not be fully priced into all consensus models.

**Finding 2: HBM and CoWoS Identified as Key AI Supply Chain Constraints by Major Foundry**

*   **Snippet:** "Is there a scenario where HBM is more of a constraint on the demand, rather than CoWoS which seems to be the biggest constraint at the moment? [Answer] I don't comment on other supplier, but I know that we have a very tight capacity to support the AI demand. I don't want to say I'm the bottleneck. TSMC, always working very hard with customer to meet their requirement…"
*   **Date:** March 3, 2025 (While the article is dated March 3, 2025, and some content refers to "last 3 months" in other contexts, this specific quote from a TSMC executive is from their Q4 2024 earnings call, making it slightly outside the strict 3-month filter for *publication date*. However, it remains highly relevant to the ongoing supply chain discussion.)
*   **Source:** The Latest Thoughts From American Technology Companies On AI (2024 Q4) - Part 2 (via vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com)
*   **Impact:** High. TSMC is NVIDIA's primary foundry partner. Their acknowledgment of "very tight capacity" for AI demand, specifically mentioning HBM and CoWoS (which relies on ABF substrates), directly implies that any issues with ABF film would compound these existing constraints. This reinforces the vulnerability of NVIDIA's supply chain to material shortages.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general idea of HBM and CoWoS constraints is known, but the specific nuance of TSMC's direct acknowledgment of "very tight capacity" and the ongoing debate about which is the "biggest constraint" could be overlooked by some, making the underlying material (ABF film) a non-consensus risk factor.

**Finding 3: NVIDIA Pushing for Accelerated HBM Product Launches**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia keeps trying to pull in the HBM product launch date progression."
*   **Date:** June 16, 2025
*   **Source:** HBM: The Hidden AI Bottleneck That Makes Micron A Strong Buy Before Earnings, Seeking Alpha (via vertexaisearch.google.com)
*   **Impact:** Medium. This highlights NVIDIA's aggressive demand for HBM and its desire to accelerate new product introductions. This pressure on HBM suppliers indirectly translates to pressure on the entire HBM supply chain, including ABF film manufacturers like Ajinomoto. Any hiccup in ABF film supply could directly impede NVIDIA's ability to meet its aggressive launch timelines and market demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** NVIDIA's strong demand for HBM is widely known. However, the active "pulling in" of launch dates suggests an even more intense demand and potentially a tighter supply situation than generally perceived, making the underlying material supply a non-consensus risk.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding ABF film supply. The information consistently points to a tight HBM market.
*   **Gaps:** The primary gap is the absence of direct, specific, and recent public information from Ajinomoto or other niche supply chain sources explicitly detailing ABF film capacity updates for HBM or forecasting rationing risks for Q4 FY2026. This lack of information itself could be a signal, either that no such issues exist, or that the information is highly guarded due to its sensitive nature and potential market impact. The research could not penetrate this information barrier through public web searches.
