## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, the following material, non-consensus information regarding TSMC's CoWoS capacity utilization, primarily from DigiTimes within the last 30 days, is likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The key finding is a reported 60% CoWoS capacity utilization, which contradicts the widely held market belief of persistent severe CoWoS shortages. This suggests a potential near-term softening of demand or an overestimation of TSMC's rapid capacity ramp-up.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The most significant and potentially non-consensus information is a recent DigiTimes report indicating that TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging technology is operating at only 60% capacity utilization as of early August 2025. This figure is notably lower than what the market generally perceives, where CoWoS capacity has been considered a major bottleneck for AI chip production, particularly for NVIDIA.

Supply chain insiders suggest this lower utilization could be due to TSMC's aggressive expansion outpacing actual demand, or "short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients." While the long-term outlook for AI demand remains strong, this implies a potential near-term slowdown in advanced packaging demand, further supported by observations of restrained spending on CoWoS equipment procurement.

Despite this, previous estimates still show TSMC's CoWoS capacity expanding significantly, with over half allocated to NVIDIA, and monthly capacity projected to reach 65,000-75,000 units by the end of 2025. This creates a contradiction: if NVIDIA has secured a large portion of capacity, but overall utilization is low, it could point to a temporary dip in NVIDIA's own demand or a shift in product mix.

Adding to potential supply chain complexities, another report from early August highlights a "fiberglass crunch" impacting CoWoS growth, with relief not expected until 2026. While overall utilization might be low, specific material shortages could still affect certain CoWoS configurations or future ramp-ups. Furthermore, NVIDIA's strategic shift towards "CoWoP" (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Package) packaging indicates the company's proactive measures to secure and optimize its advanced packaging solutions, which could influence future CoWoS demand dynamics.

This information suggests that the CoWoS bottleneck, previously a significant constraint for NVIDIA, might be easing in the near term, or that demand for certain products requiring CoWoS has temporarily softened. This could impact NVIDIA's revenue growth if it's no longer solely supply-constrained, or it could signal a transition period as NVIDIA shifts to new product generations like Blackwell, which utilize advanced packaging like CoWoS-L.

### Structured Findings

**1. TSMC CoWoS Capacity Utilization Reportedly at 60%**
*   **Snippet:** "Reports have emerged that TSMC's advanced packaging technology, CoWoS, is operating at only 60% capacity utilization. Such a supply-demand mismatch has confused the supply chain."
*   **Date:** Tuesday, August 5, 2025

*   **Impact:** High. This directly challenges the consensus view of a severe CoWoS shortage, suggesting that packaging may not be the primary constraint for NVIDIA's shipments in the immediate term. This could lead to questions about demand strength or inventory levels.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market generally assumes CoWoS capacity is a major bottleneck.

**2. Reasons for Lower CoWoS Utilization and Near-Term Outlook**
*   **Snippet:** "Supply chain insiders suggest this situation may stem from TSMC's rapid expansion outpacing actual demand or possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients. While AI demand remains strong and TSMC maintains a positive long-term outlook on AI growth, there is evidence of restrained spending on CoWoS equipment procurement behind the scenes."

*   **Impact:** High. The mention of "short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia" is a direct and material implication for NVIDIA's current quarter and near-term guidance. Restrained equipment procurement further suggests a more cautious near-term outlook for advanced packaging demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market generally focuses on the long-term AI demand narrative, potentially missing these short-term adjustments.

**3. CoWoS Capacity Expansion and NVIDIA's Allocation**
*   **Snippet:** "Previous estimates indicate that TSMC(2330.TW) has accelerated CoWoS packaging capacity expansion in recent years, with over half of this capacity allocated to Nvidia. Other ASIC chip customers like AMD have also increased wafer starts. Monthly capacity is projected to reach between 65,000 and 75,000 units by the end of 2025, rising to around 100,000 units by the end of 2026."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While NVIDIA's significant allocation is generally known, this snippet provides specific capacity projections. The contradiction between high allocation and low utilization (from Finding 1) is a key point for analysis.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known (NVIDIA's large allocation), but the context of current low utilization makes it non-consensus.

**4. CoWoS Growth Stalls on Fiberglass Crunch**
*   **Snippet:** "CoWoS growth stalls on fiberglass crunch; Unimicron sees relief in 2026."
*   **Date:** Friday, August 1, 2025
*   **Source:** DIGITIMES, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHsQg1mnQ3jMIIhGkc1x8msiZIVOCx20o-s6izp0Elld23LWzYZTB2yGhSYBo6c3r0rksXR0V1qWYNPRQXpMm_iN4PEzD-vTCwsX4gRIv9yN34f77PLsgL_g-upZSVTZBfKJei0I3WRDk8i6w==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHsQg1mnQ3jMIIhGkc1x8msiZIVOCx20o-s6izp0Elld23LWzYZTB2yGhSYBo6c3r0rksXR0V1qWYNPRQXpMm_iN4PEzD-vTCwsX4gRIv9yN34f77PLsgL_g-upZSVTZBfKJei0I3WRDk8i6w==)
*   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates a specific material-related bottleneck in the CoWoS supply chain. Even with overall lower utilization, a crunch in a critical component like fiberglass could still impact the production of specific CoWoS types or future expansion plans, potentially affecting NVIDIA's ability to ramp up certain products.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Specific material shortages are often overlooked in broader capacity discussions.

**5. NVIDIA's CoWoP Packaging Shift**
*   **Snippet:** "From substrate to system: A deep dive into Nvidia's CoWoP packaging shift. As artificial intelligence and high-performance computing enter a phase of explosive growth, the limitations of traditional chip manufacturing and the slowing of Moore's Law have..."

*   **Impact:** Low to Medium. This highlights NVIDIA's strategic efforts in advanced packaging beyond traditional CoWoS. While not directly impacting current CoWoS utilization, it signals NVIDIA's long-term strategy to optimize its packaging solutions, which could influence future demand for TSMC's CoWoS and related technologies.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. NVIDIA's focus on advanced packaging is understood, but the specifics of a "CoWoP packaging shift" might be more niche.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradiction:** The most significant contradiction is between the reported 60% CoWoS capacity utilization and the prevailing market narrative of severe CoWoS shortages that have constrained NVIDIA's supply. This suggests either a rapid oversupply by TSMC, a temporary dip in demand from key customers, or a combination of factors.
*   **Gap:** The reports do not explicitly state the specific NVIDIA products (e.g., Hopper vs. Blackwell) that might be experiencing "short-term adjustments in wafer starts." This detail would be crucial for understanding the impact on NVIDIA's revenue mix and guidance.
*   **Gap:** While a "fiberglass crunch" is mentioned, the direct impact on NVIDIA's specific CoWoS-L or other advanced packaging needs is not detailed.
