## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025. Analysis of options activity reveals a nuanced picture, with conflicting signals between short-term bullish sentiment and longer-term bearish positioning, alongside specific insights into implied volatility and skew. This suggests a market grappling with NVIDIA's high valuation and future growth trajectory despite strong underlying demand for its AI chips.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Conflicting Put/Call Ratios Indicate Mixed Sentiment:** While recent options volume shows a bullish bias, longer-term open interest suggests lingering caution. The put-call ratio for volume stood at 0.68 on August 26, 2025, signaling that call volume outpaced puts and indicating a bullish sentiment. Similarly, on August 26, 2025, another source reported a volume put-call ratio of 0.37, reinforcing a bullish outlook. However, the 150-day put-call ratio for open interest was 1.0557 on August 26, 2025, suggesting a more cautious or even bearish stance among long-term investors who may be hedging against potential overvaluation or geopolitical risks. This is further supported by a 30-day put-call ratio (open interest) of 1.0844 on August 25, 2025. This divergence highlights a non-consensus view, where short-term traders are more optimistic, but longer-term investors are exhibiting caution.
*   **Significant Bearish Options Flow Observed:** On August 22, 2025, unusual bearish options activity was noted, including a $6.9 million "Buy-To-Open" in NVDA $146 Puts expiring on June 18, 2026, and a $4.7 million "Sell-To-Open" in NVDA $187.5 Calls expiring on September 19, 2025. This substantial bearish positioning, particularly the long-dated puts, could indicate sophisticated investors hedging large long positions or making a directional bet against NVIDIA's sustained upside, representing a non-consensus view amidst the prevailing bullish narrative.
*   **Elevated Implied Volatility with a Nuanced Expected Move:** NVIDIA's implied volatility (IV) is significantly higher than its historical volatility, reflecting expectations of sharp price swings post-earnings. On August 26, 2025, NVIDIA's IV was 43.76%, considerably higher than its historical volatility of 25.68%. This implies a potential stock price move of 6.36% in either direction. Other estimates for the expected move range from 6% to 7.5%. However, a key non-consensus detail is that the implied 6.1% move is the *smallest* expected post-earnings swing since the first quarter of 2024. Furthermore, over the last eight quarters, realized earnings-day swings have averaged 5.9%, consistently lower than the 8.6% average implied by options, suggesting that the market often overprices the magnitude of post-earnings moves for NVDA.
*   **Slight Put Skew for This Week's Expiry:** For options expiring on August 29, 2025, the 25-Delta Put - Call Implied Volatility (IV) spread is 1.4. This indicates a slight put skew, meaning that out-of-the-money put options are relatively more expensive than out-of-the-money call options at the same delta. This suggests a higher demand for downside protection, which is a subtle bearish signal for the very short term.
*   **Aggressive Bullish Call Activity on Earnings Day:** Despite some underlying caution, there was significant bullish activity in calls expiring this week on the day of earnings. As of 11:36 AM on August 27, 2025, 36,932 NVDA Aug-29-25 $180 call contracts had traded, accounting for 5.1% of all NVDA option volume. Of this, 55% was attributed to large or institutional trades, and 68.2% of contracts were bought on the ask or above the midpoint, indicating aggressive buying interest. The implied volatility on this specific call surged from 74.5 to 77.8 (up 4.5%), signaling heightened market expectation for an upward move.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "The put-call ratio for volume stands at 0.68, signaling a bullish bias as call volume outpaces puts. This aligns with the company's recent earnings performance, where data center revenue surged 50% year-over-year, driven by Blackwell architecture and hyperscaler demand. However, the 150-day put-call ratio (open interest) of 1.0557 suggests lingering caution among long-term investors, who may be hedging against potential overvaluation or geopolitical risks."

    *   **Impact:** High. This highlights a significant divergence in short-term (bullish volume) vs. longer-term (cautious open interest) sentiment, which can lead to increased volatility and unexpected price action post-earnings.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While individual ratios might be known, the direct contradiction between short-term volume and long-term open interest put/call ratios is a non-consensus insight.

*   **Snippet:** "On August 22, Unusual Whales caught some serious bearish action that made heads turn: $6.9M Buy-To-Open in NVDA $146 Puts (expires June 18, 2026); $4.7M Sell-To-Open in NVDA $187.5 Calls (expires September 19, 2025)."

    *   **Source:** The Tradable, [URL not available in snippet]
    *   **Impact:** High. Large, aggressive bearish bets, especially long-dated puts, suggest a significant hedge or a strong directional conviction against the stock, which is material and non-consensus given the generally bullish sentiment around NVDA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While "unusual options activity" is reported, the specific details and magnitude of these bearish trades are likely not widely incorporated into mainstream analyst expectations.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia options suggest mind-blowing $270 billion move in stock. Contracts imply a 6.1% move in either direction, which translates into about $270 billion in market value — a shift larger than the market capitalization of most S&P 500 companies. Despite the staggering figure, it is actually the smallest expected post-earnings swing since the first quarter of 2024, when options priced in a bigger move. Over the last eight quarters, realized earnings-day swings have averaged 5.9%, consistently lower than the 8.6% average implied by options."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While high implied volatility is expected, the nuance that the *expected* move is the smallest in over a year, and that *realized* moves historically underperform implied moves, is a material detail that could temper expectations for an outsized post-earnings reaction.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The headline figure of a large move is consensus, but the comparative analysis of implied vs. realized moves and the "smallest expected swing" detail is non-consensus.

*   **Snippet:** "The Aug-29-25 $180 call traded a remarkable 36,932 contracts as of 11:36 AM—representing 5.1% of all NVDA option volume so far. ... 55% of the contract's volume was attributed to large or institutional trades, versus 45% from retail-sized orders. The overall order flow skews bullish, with 68.2% of contracts bought on the ask or above midpoint... Implied volatility on the 180 call surged from yesterday's 74.5 to 77.8 (up 4.5%)."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates strong, aggressive short-term bullish conviction from institutional players specifically for this week's expiration, potentially counteracting the longer-term bearish signals.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known for active traders, but the aggressive nature and institutional dominance might be overlooked by broader market participants.

*   **Snippet:** "One-Year 25D IV Put - Call [for Aug 29, 2025] is 1.4."
    *   **Date:** August 26, 2025 (data for Aug 29, 2025 expiry)
    *   **Source:** Market Chameleon, [URL not available in snippet]
    *   **Impact:** Low. A slight put skew indicates a marginal preference for downside protection for this week's expiry, a subtle bearish signal.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Volatility skew is a more technical metric not typically highlighted in mainstream earnings previews.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The short-term put/call volume ratios (bullish) contradict the longer-term put/call open interest ratios (cautious/bearish). This suggests a battle between immediate speculative optimism and more measured, perhaps hedged, long-term positioning.
*   **Contradiction:** The aggressive bullish call buying for this week's expiry directly contrasts with the significant bearish put buying and call selling observed just days prior for longer-dated options. This highlights a highly divided market sentiment.
*   **Gap:** While implied volatility is high, there's a historical tendency for realized moves to be smaller than implied. This gap between expectation and historical reality could lead to a "sell the news" event if the actual move is less dramatic than priced in.
*   **Gap:** The analysis of put/call ratio and skew provides insight into market sentiment but does not directly reveal the underlying reasons for these positions (e.g., whether large put positions are hedges against long stock, or outright bearish bets).
