## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information regarding NVIDIA's (NVDA) GPU availability in cloud marketplaces, likely to impact its Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The findings indicate persistent supply constraints for both current-generation Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell GPUs, driven by specific bottlenecks in the supply chain and a phased rollout strategy for new products. This suggests that while demand remains robust, NVIDIA's ability to fully capitalize on it may be hampered by production limitations, potentially leading to continued backorders and limited on-demand availability in key cloud regions.

---

**Structured Findings:**

**1. Persistent On-Demand Unavailability of NVIDIA H100 GPUs Across Cloud Providers**

*   **Snippet:** "Latest cards like H100 are frequently unavailable on demand. It is hard to identify GPU capacity. During our benchmark, we could check the GPU cards that we can launch by region. For example, AWS price calculator provides this functionality. However, we couldn't find data on capacity for any region. Therefore, we needed to try initiating instances in many combinations of regions and instance types to find a combination where we could use GPUs."
*   **Date:** August 5, 2025
*   **Source:** Top Cloud GPU Providers 2025: Best GPUs for AI Workloads - Compute with Hivenet, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High. This directly indicates a widespread and persistent issue with on-demand availability of H100 GPUs across major cloud providers, including AWS, and potentially others. The necessity for users to "try initiating instances in many combinations of regions and instance types" strongly suggests a sold-out or backordered situation without explicit regional listings. This could limit immediate revenue recognition from on-demand cloud consumption.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While strong demand is consensus, the specific difficulty in *on-demand provisioning* and the lack of transparent capacity data across regions is a more granular, non-consensus insight into the operational challenges faced by cloud users.

**2. Critical Supply Constraints for Blackwell GPUs**

*   **Snippet:** "Limited Blackwell GPU supply (few thousand units/quarter) raises doubts about scaling to meet hyperscaler needs."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** Nvidia's Earnings: A Litmus Test for the AI-Driven Market's Viability - AInvest, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High. This is a very specific and recent quantitative data point regarding the supply of NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPUs. A supply of "few thousand units/quarter" is significantly low given the "insatiable demand" from hyperscalers. This constraint could severely limit the ramp-up of Blackwell revenue in the near term and impact forward-looking guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the excitement around Blackwell is high, specific figures on its initial production limitations are likely not widely known or fully factored into consensus expectations, which might be more optimistic about the immediate availability of next-gen hardware.

**3. Persistent Bottlenecks in HBM3E Memory and GPU Manufacturing**

*   **Snippet:** "The AI GPU supply chain in 2025 is a minefield of constraints. NVIDIA's inventory turnover has rebounded to 4.25 times per year, but bottlenecks persist in HBM3E memory production and GPU manufacturing."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** CoreWeave's Strategic Verticalization and AI Cloud Dominance in 2025: A Path to Outsized Returns Amid Supply Constraints - AInvest, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High. This finding identifies specific, ongoing bottlenecks within the broader AI GPU supply chain, particularly in HBM3E memory and general GPU manufacturing. These are critical components for both Hopper and Blackwell architectures. These persistent issues directly explain the "unavailable on demand" and "limited supply" observations, indicating a systemic challenge that could continue to constrain NVIDIA's ability to meet demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general supply chain issues are acknowledged, the specific and ongoing nature of HBM3E memory and GPU manufacturing bottlenecks, despite NVIDIA's improved inventory turnover, provides a more nuanced and potentially non-consensus view of the underlying causes of supply limitations.

**4. Phased Rollout of NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs in Cloud**

*   **Snippet:** "Cloud service providers CoreWeave and Google Cloud are now offering instances accelerated by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, with additional instances coming later this year from AWS, Nebius and Vultr."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025
*   **Source:** Industry Leaders Transform Enterprise Data Centers for the AI Era With NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers, NVIDIA Newsroom, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates a staggered availability of a specific Blackwell variant (RTX PRO 6000 Server Edition) across cloud providers. While CoreWeave and Google Cloud have it, AWS, Nebius, and Vultr will only get it "later this year." This implies that a significant portion of the cloud market is still awaiting these newer Blackwell instances, which could temper expectations for immediate, widespread Blackwell-driven revenue growth from all major hyperscalers in Q2 FY2026.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the general availability of Blackwell is anticipated, the specific, phased rollout for particular Blackwell SKUs and the timing for major providers like AWS is a detail that might not be fully appreciated by the broader market, which might assume more immediate and universal availability.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Blackwell Availability:** There's a slight contradiction between (May 28, 2025), which states "NVIDIA Blackwell cloud instances are now available on AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure," and (August 26, 2025), which says "additional instances coming later this year from AWS" for the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition. This suggests that while some "Blackwell cloud instances" might be generally available, specific, newer, or higher-end Blackwell SKUs (like the RTX PRO 6000 Server Edition) are still in a phased rollout, with AWS lagging for this particular variant. This nuance is important.
*   **Regional Specificity:** While implies widespread unavailability of H100s across regions, it doesn't provide explicit "sold out" or "backordered" listings by specific regions for Azure or AWS. The challenge in identifying capacity by region remains a gap.
*   **"Sold Out" vs. "Backordered":** The findings strongly suggest a state of scarcity and difficulty in obtaining GPUs on demand, which functionally equates to "sold out" or "backordered" for immediate access. However, explicit "sold out" or "backordered" labels from cloud marketplaces themselves are not directly provided in the snippets, rather inferred from user experience and supply chain analysis.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The research indicates that NVIDIA continues to face significant supply constraints for its high-demand GPUs, particularly the H100 and the newly introduced Blackwell architecture. These constraints are rooted in specific bottlenecks within the manufacturing process, including HBM3E memory. While demand from cloud providers remains "insatiable," the ability to provision these GPUs on-demand is challenging, and the rollout of new Blackwell variants is phased. This non-consensus information suggests that NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings and especially its forward-looking guidance could be impacted by these supply limitations, potentially leading to a more conservative outlook on revenue growth despite robust underlying demand. Investors should consider that the "insatiable demand" narrative might be tempered by the practical realities of supply chain bottlenecks and phased product rollouts.
