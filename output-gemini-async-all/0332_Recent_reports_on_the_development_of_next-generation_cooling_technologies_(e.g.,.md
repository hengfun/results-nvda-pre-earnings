**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report for Q2 FY2026 will likely reflect the accelerating impact of AI on data center infrastructure, particularly in the realm of cooling. The sheer power density of NVIDIA's latest GPUs, such as the GB200 and Blackwell, has made traditional air cooling obsolete for many high-performance AI workloads. As a result, liquid cooling, especially direct-to-chip solutions, is rapidly moving from a niche technology to a mainstream necessity.

TrendForce's projection of liquid cooling penetration in AI data centers surging to 33% in 2025, largely driven by NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72 rack servers, is a critical data point. This indicates a significant and immediate tailwind for NVIDIA, as the demand for its powerful GPUs directly translates into a requirement for advanced cooling infrastructure. NVIDIA is not merely a passive beneficiary; it's actively shaping this transition through collaborations with partners like nVent Electric, which is developing built-to-spec liquid cooling solutions for NVIDIA's platforms. Furthermore, NVIDIA is integrating liquid cooling into its own networking components, demonstrating a holistic approach to thermal management within its "AI factories."

However, the picture isn't entirely without nuance. While direct-to-chip liquid cooling is gaining rapid traction, the broader adoption of full immersion cooling appears to be on a slightly longer timeline, with NVIDIA's "Rubin Ultra" GPU (expected in 2027) cited as a potential catalyst for that segment. The current lack of lifespan certification for immersion cooling on NVIDIA's GPUs is noted as a factor slowing its immediate uptake. This suggests that while NVIDIA is leading the charge in liquid cooling, there's still room for strategic development and certification in the immersion space.

A potential near-term concern lies with key supply chain partners like Supermicro. While Supermicro is expanding its offerings for NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture with advanced liquid cooling, recent reports of supply chain constraints and reduced revenue guidance for Supermicro could signal potential bottlenecks in the deployment of NVIDIA's high-density AI systems. Investors will be keen to understand how NVIDIA is mitigating such risks to ensure the smooth rollout of its GPU platforms.

Overall, the strong and immediate demand for liquid cooling driven by NVIDIA's high-performance AI GPUs is a material positive for the company. The extent to which NVIDIA can capitalize on this by offering integrated solutions, strengthening its cooling ecosystem partnerships, and addressing any supply chain or certification hurdles will be crucial for its continued growth and market leadership in the AI era.
