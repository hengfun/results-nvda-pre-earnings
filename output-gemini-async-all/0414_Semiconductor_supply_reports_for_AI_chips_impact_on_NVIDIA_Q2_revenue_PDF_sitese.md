## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis for NVIDIA (NVDA) focusing on material, non-consensus information from recent semiconductor supply reports and related disclosures. NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY226 earnings today, August 27, 2025.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The semiconductor industry, particularly the AI chip segment, experienced a significant rebound in Q2 2025, driven by accelerating demand from data centers and cloud providers. This robust demand is a strong tailwind for NVIDIA, which continues to dominate the AI chip design market. Key suppliers like TSMC reported strong Q2 revenues, largely attributed to AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) demand, and provided optimistic Q3 guidance, indicating sustained demand for NVIDIA's advanced chips.

A notable non-consensus insight comes from the supply chain for High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). SK Hynix, a critical supplier for NVIDIA, significantly increased its HBM contribution to DRAM revenue in Q1 2025 and is positioned as a leading supplier of HBM3E for NVIDIA's next-generation AI GPUs, with early sampling of HBM4. This suggests a strong and potentially improving supply of a crucial component for NVIDIA's most advanced products, which could alleviate potential bottlenecks and support higher revenue.

Furthermore, NVIDIA's strategic moves in advanced packaging and power solutions are coming to light. The company is transitioning to COWOS-long technology for its new GPUs, enabling greater integration and performance, which is crucial for its Blackwell architecture. A key partner, Navitas Semiconductor, announced NVIDIA's selection for next-generation 800-volt data centers, indicating NVIDIA's focus on optimizing power delivery for its expanding AI infrastructure. Navitas's new GaN foundry partnership with Powerchip aims to support these AI data center opportunities, potentially securing a more robust and cost-effective power semiconductor supply for NVIDIA's ecosystem.

While the overall picture points to strong demand and improving supply chain dynamics for NVIDIA's core AI business, the information on specific capacity increases for advanced packaging or HBM beyond what is generally known could be particularly impactful. The continued dominance of NVIDIA in AI chip design, coupled with strong performance from its key suppliers and strategic partnerships, suggests a favorable environment for its Q2 earnings and future guidance, potentially exceeding some market expectations regarding supply chain constraints.

### Structured Findings

**Finding 2:**

*   **Snippet:** "Emerging market semiconductor stocks rebounded sharply in the Q2, recovering from a difficult first quarter that saw broad-based declines across the sector. The weakness in Q1 was driven by a combination of seasonal inventory overhang, softer end-market demand, and heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty... However, the sector dynamics improved in Q2 with accelerating demand for AI chips and related hardware... SK Hynix has continued to capitalize on the AI-driven demand for advanced memory chips. As a global leader in high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the company reported record DRAM operating margins in Q1, with HBM now contributing 49% of DRAM revenue. Its position as the leading supplier of HBM3E for Nvidia's next-generation AI GPUs, along with early sampling of HBM4, highlights its technological leadership."

*   **Impact:** High. The rebound in Q2 for semiconductor stocks due to accelerating AI chip demand directly benefits NVIDIA. More importantly, SK Hynix's strong HBM performance and its role as a leading supplier for NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs (HBM3E and HBM4 sampling) suggest a robust supply of a critical component, potentially easing concerns about HBM availability and supporting higher-than-expected revenue.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general rebound in semiconductors is likely known, but the specific details about SK Hynix's HBM contribution (49% of DRAM revenue in Q1) and its direct supply to NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs might be non-consensus and highly material.

**Finding 5:**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia is transitioning its complex chip-on- wafer-on-substrate (COWOS) packaging technology (offered by Taiwan Semiconductor. Manufacturing [TSMC]), moving from COWOS- short to COWOS-long technology for new. GPUs. This shift to COWOS-long enables the integration of multiple chips, including GPU cores and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), on a single substrate, resulting in better performance and efficiency.4 It also enables the stacking of up to 12 HBM3 devices at a lower cost and uses local silicon interconnect bridges and an organic interposer that functions as a redistribution layer to increase interconnect densities, as well as provides a bandwidth of ten terabytes per second between compute chiplets. These features are particularly crucial for Nvidia's Blackwell architecture as the company increases the efficiency and power of its AI chip designs."

*   **Impact:** Medium-High. NVIDIA's transition to COWOS-long packaging technology for its Blackwell architecture is a significant technological advancement. This move, enabling higher integration and efficiency at potentially lower cost for HBM stacking, could lead to improved performance, better margins, and a competitive edge. It addresses the increasing complexity and power demands of AI chips.
*   **Consensus Check:** While NVIDIA's continuous innovation is known, the specific details of the COWOS-long transition and its implications for Blackwell architecture and cost efficiency might be more detailed than general market knowledge, offering a deeper understanding of NVIDIA's technological roadmap and its impact on future product costs and performance.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found among the snippets. All information points towards strong demand for AI chips and NVIDIA's dominant position, with key suppliers and partners showing positive trends.
*   **Gaps:** While the reports indicate strong demand and improving supply for critical components like HBM, specific quantitative figures on NVIDIA's *own* order fulfillment rates or any remaining bottlenecks for Q2 FY2026 are not explicitly detailed. The impact of the "potential impact of tariff policies" mentioned by TSMC is noted as an uncertainty but not quantified in terms of its effect on NVIDIA's specific revenue or guidance. More granular data on the actual ramp-up and yield rates of the new COWOS-long technology or the GaN foundry partnership would provide even greater clarity.
