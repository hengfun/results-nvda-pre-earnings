## Analysis

Here are the key findings from Micron's recent earnings reports and related analyses, providing material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance for Q3 FY2026:

---

**Structured Findings:**

-   **Snippet:** "Micron Technology on Monday raised its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted profit, banking on surging demand for its memory chips used in artificial intelligence infrastructure... The company now expects quarterly revenue of $11.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared with its previous forecast of $10.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Micron also nudged up its adjusted gross margin forecast to 44.5 per cent, plus or minus 0.5 per cent, for the fourth quarter, compared with its prior expectation of 42 per cent, plus or minus 1 per cent. Micron expects adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.85 per share, plus or minus 7 cents, compared with its earlier expectation of $2.50, plus or minus 15 cents."
    *   **Date:** August 11, 2025
    *   **Source:** CNA, [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/micron-raises-forecasts-ai-boosts-memory-chip-demand-4530046](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/micron-raises-forecasts-ai-boosts-memory-chip-demand-4530046)
    *   **Impact:** High. This is a very recent, significant upward revision to Micron's Q4 FY2025 guidance (ending August 2025), which directly overlaps with NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026. The substantial increase in revenue, gross margin, and EPS forecasts signals stronger-than-expected demand and pricing power for AI-driven memory, a direct positive read-through for NVIDIA's data center segment.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This is a recent update to Micron's guidance, and while reported, the full implications for NVIDIA's specific quarter-end (July 2025) and forward guidance might not be fully priced into NVIDIA's stock, especially the magnitude of the margin improvement.

-   **Snippet:** "Micron Technology has begun mass production of its fifth-generation HBM3E chips after completing Nvidia's quality verification process. These chips will be used in Nvidia's upcoming AI accelerator, the Blackwell Ultra. Micron is the second supplier, after SK hynix, to provide HBM3E chips to Nvidia. Samsung is still in the product qualification stage."
    *   **Date:** April 13, 2025
    *   **Source:** Tech in Asia, [https://www.techinasia.com/micron-begins-mass-production-ai-chips-nvidia](https://www.techinasia.com/micron-begins-mass-production-ai-chips-nvidia)
    *   **Impact:** High. Confirmation of Micron's HBM3E mass production for NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra and its status as the second qualified supplier (ahead of Samsung) is crucial. This indicates a more diversified and potentially more robust HBM supply chain for NVIDIA's next-generation AI accelerators, which could alleviate concerns about supply constraints and enable a faster ramp of Blackwell Ultra.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While Micron's HBM3E qualification for NVIDIA H200 was known earlier (Feb 2024), the specific confirmation for Blackwell Ultra and the competitive positioning against Samsung (still in qualification) is a more recent and potentially overlooked detail that underscores NVIDIA's strong supply chain for its most advanced chips.

-   **Snippet:** "Our HBM is sold out for calendar year 2025, and anticipates HBM bit demand growth will 'significantly exceed' overall DRAM demand in CY2026. The consolidated gross margin increase in Q3 FY2025 (non-GAAP) was attributed primarily to 'better-than-expected pricing' and favorable DRAM product mix."

    *   **Impact:** High. The "sold out" status for 2025 and significantly faster growth expected in 2026 for HBM bits confirms extremely strong, sustained demand for the critical memory component used in NVIDIA's GPUs. This implies continued strong revenue potential for NVIDIA, though it also signals a tight supply environment. The mention of "better-than-expected pricing" for DRAM, particularly HBM, suggests NVIDIA may face higher input costs, but also that the overall AI market is robust enough to absorb these.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The general strength of HBM demand is widely known, but the explicit "sold out" for 2025 and the strong 2026 outlook from a key supplier like Micron, coupled with specific pricing commentary, provides a more granular and potentially underappreciated view of the market's tightness and pricing dynamics.

-   **Snippet:** "In fiscal Q3, data center DRAM revenue reached a new record for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by strong growth and share gains in HBM, and robust performance by our industry-leading portfolio of high-capacity DIMMs and low-power server DRAM products."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This highlights the broad strength in data center memory demand beyond just HBM, including high-capacity DIMMs and low-power server DRAM. This suggests that the AI buildout is not only driving demand for specialized HBM but also for other types of memory crucial for data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA's broader data center platform sales (e.g., networking, CPUs, and other components that go into AI servers).
    *   **Consensus Check:** While HBM is the primary focus, the sustained record revenue in broader data center DRAM for four consecutive quarters might be slightly overlooked, indicating a more pervasive and robust demand environment for AI infrastructure components.

-   **Snippet:** "Micron is already secured for HBM production through 2025, with demand exceeding supply for 2026, they have already publicly indicated 10-15% price increases, and the same technical pattern indicates it can be much higher with upside potential of $156-190."

    *   **Source:** Micron: The Underpriced AI Memory King Facing A Quiet Supply Shock - Seeking Alpha, [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4627254-micron-underpriced-ai-memory-king-facing-quiet-supply-shock](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4627254-micron-underpriced-ai-memory-king-facing-quiet-supply-shock)
    *   **Impact:** Medium. The explicit mention of 10-15% price increases for 2025-2026 and demand exceeding supply for 2026 underscores the tight supply-demand balance and Micron's pricing power. This could translate to higher COGS for NVIDIA, but also reinforces the strong demand environment that allows NVIDIA to maintain its own premium pricing. The "quiet supply shock" framing suggests this pricing power might be more significant and sustained than generally perceived.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While some price increases are expected, the specific 10-15% figure and the "demand exceeding supply for 2026" from an August 2025 article could be a more recent and potentially non-consensus view on the extent and duration of HBM pricing strength.

-   **Snippet:** "Micron expects its HBM market share to grow to the 22-23 percent level, matching its overall DRAM market share, behind Samsung (41.1 percent) and SK hynix (34.8 percent). It thinks it could achieve this in calendar 2025."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. Micron's ambitious target to significantly increase its HBM market share to 22-23% by calendar year-end 2025 suggests an aggressive ramp-up in production and strong customer wins. For NVIDIA, this implies a more diversified and potentially more competitive HBM supplier base, which could be beneficial for long-term supply stability and potentially for negotiating power, though the immediate impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings might be indirect.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The specific market share target and the timeline for achieving it from a relatively smaller player in the HBM market (compared to SK Hynix and Samsung) might be a less discussed aspect of the HBM supply landscape.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Micron Technology's recent Q3 FY2025 earnings report (June 25, 2025) and subsequent updates to its Q4 FY2025 guidance (August 11, 2025) paint a very bullish picture for the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) market and, by extension, for NVIDIA's data center demand.

**Key Takeaways for NVIDIA:**

1.  **Accelerating HBM Demand and Pricing Power:** Micron significantly raised its Q4 FY2025 revenue and profit forecasts, citing "surging demand for its memory chips used in artificial intelligence infrastructure" and "improved pricing." This indicates that the demand for critical AI components, particularly HBM, is not only robust but accelerating, directly benefiting NVIDIA. Micron's HBM is "sold out for calendar year 2025," with demand expected to "significantly exceed" overall DRAM growth in 2026, and the company has indicated 10-15% price increases for 2025-2026. This suggests NVIDIA will continue to see strong demand for its GPUs, but also potentially face higher input costs for HBM, which its strong pricing power for GPUs should easily absorb.

2.  **Blackwell Ultra HBM Supply Secured:** Crucially, Micron has confirmed it has begun mass production of its HBM3E chips after completing NVIDIA's quality verification process, and these chips will be used in NVIDIA's upcoming AI accelerator, the Blackwell Ultra. Micron is now the second qualified supplier for NVIDIA's HBM3E, ahead of Samsung, which is still in the qualification stage. This is a significant positive for NVIDIA, as it signals a more diversified and robust supply chain for its next-generation products, potentially mitigating concerns about HBM supply constraints for the Blackwell Ultra ramp.

3.  **Broad Data Center Strength:** Beyond HBM, Micron reported record data center DRAM revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter in Q3 FY2025, driven by both HBM and high-capacity DIMMs. This suggests that the AI buildout is driving demand across the entire data center memory ecosystem, which bodes well for NVIDIA's broader data center platform sales, including networking and other server components.

**Non-Consensus Insights:**

While the general strength of AI demand is widely acknowledged, the specific details from Micron provide more granular, potentially non-consensus insights:

*   **Magnitude of Micron's Q4 FY2025 Guidance Raise:** The extent of Micron's upward revision for Q4 FY2025 revenue, gross margin, and EPS (which aligns with NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026) is quite substantial. This suggests that the underlying demand and pricing power in the AI memory market might be even stronger than what the market has fully priced in for NVIDIA.
*   **Micron's Competitive Position in HBM3E for Blackwell Ultra:** The explicit confirmation of Micron's HBM3E mass production for Blackwell Ultra, and its lead over Samsung in qualification, highlights a potentially stronger and more diversified HBM supply chain for NVIDIA's most advanced chips than some might have anticipated. This could lead to a smoother and faster Blackwell Ultra ramp.
*   **Explicit HBM Pricing Increases and "Trade Ratio Squeeze":** The stated 10-15% price increases for HBM and the concept of a "trade ratio squeeze" creating scarcity in non-HBM DRAM underscore the intense demand and supply tightness. This level of pricing power for a memory supplier is a strong signal of the insatiable demand from AI, which is a direct tailwind for NVIDIA.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found. All sources point to strong and accelerating demand for HBM and data center memory.
*   **Gaps:** While Micron provides strong signals, the exact volume commitments from NVIDIA for Micron's HBM3E for Blackwell Ultra are not disclosed. Additionally, while pricing power is evident, the precise impact of higher HBM costs on NVIDIA's gross margins (if any, given NVIDIA's own pricing power) is not quantified by these reports. The timing and ramp of HBM4 are mentioned, but the specific impact on NVIDIA's future product generations is still a forward-looking projection.
