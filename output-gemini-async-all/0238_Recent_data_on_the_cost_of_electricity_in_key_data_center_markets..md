## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the analysis of recent electricity cost data in key data center markets reveals a significant and escalating challenge for NVIDIA's primary customers. The overwhelming consensus across various reports is that the insatiable demand for power from AI data centers is driving up electricity prices globally, straining existing grids, and leading to substantial increases in operational costs for data center operators. This trend is material for NVIDIA as it directly impacts the profitability and expansion plans of companies investing heavily in AI infrastructure and, consequently, their demand for NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs.

The information gathered highlights not only the rising costs but also the emerging bottlenecks in power supply and grid connections, which could slow down data center build-outs. While some of these trends are becoming more widely acknowledged, the specific magnitudes of price increases, the direct attribution to data centers by independent watchdogs, and the concrete regulatory responses or infrastructure delays represent non-consensus details that could influence investor perception of the AI boom's sustainability and cost structure.

### Structured Findings:

---

**1. Snippet:** "The analysis, authored by Monitoring Analytics, the independent watchdog overseeing bulk electricity market operations by regional grid operator PJM, concluded that explosive growth in electricity demand from data centers is the “primary reason” behind a sharp price surge in PJM's most recent capacity auction. That auction, which sets future prices utilities must pay for reliable electricity three years in advance, cleared at $269.92 per megawatt-day—a staggering 800% increase from the previous year."

- **Impact:** High (95) - This is a highly material, specific data point from a key US data center region (PJM includes Northern Virginia, a major hub). An 800% increase in future electricity prices for utilities, directly attributed to data centers, signals a massive and potentially overlooked cost burden that will eventually be passed on to hyperscalers and cloud providers, impacting their long-term infrastructure investment decisions and profitability.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While rising costs are known, an 800% increase from an "independent watchdog" specifically blaming data centers is a stark, non-consensus detail that could catch investors off guard.

**2. Snippet:** "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average retail price of one kilowatt-hour of electricity in the U.S. rose 6.5 percent, to 17.5 cents from 16.41 cents, between May 2024 and May 2025. Some states have been hit especially hard: ratepayers in Maine saw prices jump 36.3 percent in that period, followed by Connecticut (18.4 percent) and Utah (15.2 percent)."

- **Impact:** High (85) - Provides recent, specific national and state-level electricity price increases in the US, directly impacting data center operational costs. The significant spikes in certain states indicate localized pressures that could influence regional data center development and expansion.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but specific state-level spikes might be overlooked. The general trend of rising electricity costs is becoming more recognized, but the magnitude in specific regions could be non-consensus.

**3. Snippet:** "Newsweek reports that increased consumption from data centers already contributed to a 6.5% increase in energy prices between May 2024 and May 2025. (Though it's worth noting that's just the average, with Connecticut and Maine reporting increases of 18.4% and 36.3%, respectively.) And those numbers are expected to rise as tech companies continue to build out their AI-related infrastructure. "To keep pace, utilities are increasingly relying on aging fossil fuel plants to generate enough electricity to meet the crushing demand," Newsweek says."

- **Impact:** High (90) - Reinforces the US price increases and adds a critical detail: the reliance on "aging fossil fuel plants." This suggests not only higher operational costs due to fuel prices but also potential environmental and regulatory risks, which could lead to further cost pressures or delays in data center development.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the overall increase is becoming known, the specific implication of relying on aging fossil fuel plants and its long-term cost/risk profile might be less discussed.

**4. Snippet:** "A joint study from Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University found electricity prices could climb as much as 8% nationwide by 2028, with some states seeing increases of up to 25%. The surge comes as AI technologies expand and U.S. data centers handle requests from around the world. To ease pressure, several state governments are weighing new rules. In Ohio, regulators proposed that data centers cover 85% of their projected energy use regardless of actual consumption, after residents were hit with unexpectedly high bills in June."

- **Impact:** High (90) - Provides forward-looking projections for US electricity price increases and, crucially, highlights a specific regulatory response in Ohio. This "85% projected energy use" rule could significantly increase financial risk and operational costs for data center operators, potentially slowing down investment or shifting it to more favorable states.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific regulatory proposal in Ohio is a concrete, non-consensus example of how states are reacting to the cost burden, which could set a precedent.

**5. Snippet:** "Operators of data centers in Malaysia are facing increased operational costs following a power tariff hike that took effect on July 1, 2025... The tariff hike... is expected to increase electricity costs by 10% to 14% for large consumers, including data centers. This increase does not account for potential monthly fuel surcharges... Gary Goh, founder of Sprint DC Consulting, estimates that a 100-megawatt facility could incur additional annual costs between US$15 million and US$20 million, excluding fuel surcharges."

- **Impact:** High (80) - Provides concrete, recent data on a significant power tariff hike in a growing APAC data center market. The estimated annual cost increase of $15-20 million for a large facility is a substantial operational burden that could impact the attractiveness of Malaysia for future data center investments and, by extension, demand for NVIDIA's products in the region.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This is a niche, regional policy change that might not be widely known outside of APAC-focused investors, but has a direct and material financial impact.

**6. Snippet:** "The cost of providing electricity in America's largest power market will hit a record high due to soaring demand from artificial intelligence data centres and delays in building new power plants, raising energy prices for consumers. Grid operator PJM, which covers 13 states and Washington DC, said on Tuesday it procured energy supplies for $329.17 per megawatt day, a 22 per cent increase compared with the previous year."

- **Impact:** High (98) - This is an even more recent and higher figure for the PJM capacity auction than previously found, indicating accelerating cost pressures. The direct link to "soaring demand from artificial intelligence data centres and delays in building new power plants" highlights both demand-side and supply-side issues impacting NVIDIA's customers.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the general trend of rising costs is known, this updated, higher figure for the largest US power market, coupled with specific reasons, is a very material and potentially non-consensus data point.

**7. Snippet:** "Commercial electricity rates have risen nearly 30% since 2020, reaching an average of 9.7 cents/kWh in H1 2025. This increasing cost pressure has driven development toward markets with lower power costs such as Salt Lake City (5.7 cents/kWh) and Denver (6.4 cents/kWh). Phoenix ranks positively within that spectrum, at 7.5 cents/kWh. The average wait time for a grid connection across the U.S. is now four years. Power delays remain a significant hurdle in alleviating supply constraints."

- **Impact:** High (99) - This is extremely material. A 30% rise in commercial electricity rates since 2020 and an average wait time of *four years* for a grid connection in the US represent a severe bottleneck for data center expansion. This directly impacts the ability of NVIDIA's customers to deploy new AI infrastructure, potentially slowing down GPU demand or shifting it to regions with faster grid connections, regardless of chip availability.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While power availability is discussed, the specific "four-year wait time" for grid connections is a very concrete and potentially underappreciated constraint on the pace of AI infrastructure build-out.

### Contradictions and Gaps:

**Contradictions:** There are no direct contradictions in the findings. All sources point to a clear trend of rising electricity costs driven by data center demand, particularly for AI. The differences lie in the specific regional figures and the magnitude of the increases, which is expected given varying market dynamics.

**Gaps:**
*   **Detailed APAC Data:** While Malaysia's tariff hike is noted, more granular, recent electricity cost data for other major APAC data center hubs like Singapore, Japan, and Australia would provide a more comprehensive global picture.
*   **Hyperscaler Mitigation Strategies:** The reports highlight the problem but offer less detail on how hyperscalers (NVIDIA's key customers) are actively mitigating these rising costs and grid constraints. Are they accelerating investments in on-site power generation, long-term power purchase agreements, or more aggressive energy-efficient hardware deployments (beyond just PUE improvements)?
*   **Impact on Smaller Cloud Providers:** The focus is often on large hyperscalers. The impact of these rising costs on smaller cloud providers or enterprises running their own data centers, who may have less negotiating power or capital for large-scale energy solutions, is less clear. This could lead to further consolidation or a greater reliance on hyperscalers.
*   **Geopolitical and Regulatory Nuances:** While some regulatory responses are mentioned, a deeper dive into how different governments are balancing AI growth, energy security, and consumer costs could reveal further non-consensus risks or opportunities.

This research indicates that while NVIDIA's GPU demand remains robust, the escalating and increasingly complex energy landscape presents a growing headwind for its data center customers. These rising costs and infrastructure bottlenecks could lead to slower-than-anticipated data center expansion, increased focus on energy-efficient hardware (benefiting NVIDIA's latest power-efficient GPUs), and potential shifts in regional investment strategies.
