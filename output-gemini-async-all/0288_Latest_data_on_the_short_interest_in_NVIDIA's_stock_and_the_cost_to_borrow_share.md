## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, an analysis of recent short interest data and the cost to borrow shares reveals a nuanced picture of market sentiment. While traditional short interest metrics indicate a decline in bearish bets, some market structure analysis suggests underlying short bias.

The latest available data, primarily as of July 31, 2025, shows a decrease in NVIDIA's short interest, with a relatively low percentage of its float being shorted and a minimal cost to borrow shares. This generally points to a lack of aggressive short-selling activity ahead of earnings. However, a more granular look at demand and supply dynamics by one analyst suggests a potential "short bias" that could be an overlooked factor.

***

### Structured Findings:

**1. Latest Short Interest Figures Indicate Decreased Bearish Sentiment**
*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA (NVDA) has a short interest of 192.12 million shares, representing 0.82% of the float... This marks a -4.73% decrease in short interest from the previous month. The short interest ratio (days to cover) is 1.0..."
*   **Date:** Data as of July 31, 2025, reported in articles published August 20-27, 2025.
*   **Source:** MarketBeat, Moomoo, Benzinga, ChartExchange, Nasdaq, Benzinga.
*   **Impact:** Medium. A declining short interest suggests that fewer investors are actively betting against NVIDIA's stock, which could reduce the likelihood of a significant short squeeze post-earnings. However, given NVIDIA's strong performance, low short interest might already be factored into the market's expectations.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. Multiple financial news outlets report this data, which is derived from official FINRA disclosures.

**2. NVIDIA's Short Interest is Significantly Lower Than Peers**
*   **Snippet:** "According to Benzinga Pro, NVIDIA's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.38%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers."
*   **Date:** Article published August 20, 2025.
*   **Source:** Moomoo, Benzinga.
*   **Impact:** Medium. This comparative data highlights that, relative to its industry, NVIDIA is not a heavily shorted stock. This could imply a stronger underlying belief in its long-term prospects among institutional investors, or simply that the stock's valuation has deterred aggressive shorting.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While raw short interest is known, the comparison to a peer group average is a more analytical insight that may not be as broadly disseminated.

**3. Cost to Borrow Shares Remains Low, Indicating Limited Shorting Demand**
*   **Snippet:** "Latest borrow fee for NVIDIA (NVDA) shares on Interactive Brokers: 0.2500% (annualized). Shares available to borrow: >10000000." Another source states, "As of 2025-08-24 11:47:04 PM EDT, there were 10,000,000 shares available with a fee of 0.41%."
*   **Date:** As of August 24, 2025, and other recent dates within the last 3 months.
*   **Source:** Companies Market Cap, Short Interest Tracker, ChartExchange.
*   **Impact:** Medium. A low cost to borrow and high availability of shares suggest that there isn't significant demand from short sellers to bet against NVDA. This reinforces the idea that aggressive bearish positioning is not prevalent, potentially limiting downside pressure from short-covering.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. Borrow rates are generally public data, though specific broker rates can vary slightly.

**4. Market Structure Analyst Identifies a "SHORT bias" Despite Low Short Interest**
*   **Snippet:** "I told Frank on CNBC that NVDA Demand is the weakest since May and Supply is about 55%. That's a SHORT bias. Doesn't mean the stock will fall. I can make a huge BULL case for NVDA. But. It means there's a Demand/Supply imbalance. Historically, when Demand falls below 5.0, NVDA stalls or declines. It last happened in May, though that was the end of an extended weak-Demand stretch."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025.
*   **Source:** Interactive Brokers (Tim Quast, Founder & CEO, Market Structure EDGE).
*   **Impact:** High. This is a potentially non-consensus view that goes beyond traditional short interest metrics. Tim Quast's analysis of "Demand" and "Supply" imbalances, indicating a "SHORT bias" and historical correlation with stalling/declining stock, could signal underlying weakness not captured by headline short interest figures. If this "Demand" metric is indeed weak, it could lead to a more muted positive reaction or even a negative reaction to earnings, even if the reported numbers are strong, due to a lack of buying pressure.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. This is a specialized analysis from Market Structure EDGE, which focuses on quantitative market mechanics rather than fundamental or traditional technical analysis, making it less likely to be widely discussed in mainstream pre-earnings reports.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
There are no direct contradictions in the data. The low short interest and low cost to borrow are consistent. The "SHORT bias" identified by Tim Quast is not a contradiction but rather a deeper, potentially non-consensus interpretation of market mechanics that could influence price action, even if traditional short interest is low. It highlights a potential gap in understanding if investors only focus on headline short interest numbers. The exact methodology for "Demand" and "Supply" as defined by Market Structure EDGE is not fully detailed in the snippet, which is a minor gap.
