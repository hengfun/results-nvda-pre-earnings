## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on NVIDIA (NVDA), focusing on material, non-consensus information from data center REIT filings and related reports published within the last three months, specifically concerning power expansions for hyperscaler AI clusters.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The overarching theme from recent data center REIT disclosures and industry reports is an unprecedented surge in demand for AI-ready infrastructure, directly benefiting GPU providers like NVIDIA. Data center operators are making substantial capital investments and strategic partnerships to meet the high-density power and advanced cooling requirements of next-generation AI clusters.

Specifically, **Equinix** has solidified its position as a key partner for NVIDIA, being selected as the first global partner to host Blackwell-powered DGX SuperPODs across 45 metros. This direct collaboration, coupled with Equinix's plan to invest up to $5 billion annually in data center development through 2029, underscores a significant and long-term commitment to supporting NVIDIA's advanced AI hardware. The company's Q2 2025 results further highlight robust demand for AI infrastructure, with early adopters like Groq and Block already deploying AI models within Equinix facilities.

Similarly, **Switch** is explicitly aligning its new "Rob Roy's EVO AI Factories" with NVIDIA DGX and MGX roadmaps, designing them to support extreme densities (up to 2 MW per rack) with hybrid cooling. This direct alignment signals strong future demand for NVIDIA's systems as Switch expands these specialized AI factories across its campuses.

**Digital Realty** also reports robust hyperscale demand, with significant capacity under construction and a new U.S. Hyperscale Data Center Fund aimed at supporting over $10 billion in total data center investment for AI/cloud workloads. Their partnership with Oracle to deploy GPU-based infrastructure, explicitly mentioning NVIDIA, further reinforces the demand for high-performance computing. Digital Realty's CEO has also stated "no signs of slowdown" for AI infrastructure demand, directly referencing support for "the latest of the NVIDIA chips."

While the overall picture is highly positive for NVIDIA, a notable non-consensus point emerged from Truist Securities, which upgraded AMD, citing that some AI hyperscale customers are "seriously considering the switch from Nvidia to AMD for processing power" and are engaging with AMD in a "partnership manner." This suggests a potential, albeit early, competitive dynamic that could challenge NVIDIA's current market dominance in the hyperscaler AI space.

---

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The overwhelming evidence points to robust and growing demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure. However, the Truist report on AMD introduces a potential contradiction by suggesting hyperscalers are actively exploring and partnering with AMD for AI processing power, which could challenge NVIDIA's market share.
*   **Gaps:** While the REITs discuss power expansions and high-density requirements, specific, granular data on the exact number of NVIDIA GPUs these expansions are designed to house, or the precise power allocated *per NVIDIA system*, is generally not publicly disclosed in these filings or reports. This makes it challenging to directly quantify the exact impact on NVIDIA's unit sales.
