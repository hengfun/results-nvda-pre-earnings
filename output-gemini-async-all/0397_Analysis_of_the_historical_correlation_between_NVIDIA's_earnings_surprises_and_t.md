## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is poised to release its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025. An analysis of the historical correlation between NVIDIA's earnings surprises and its subsequent stock price performance reveals a nuanced picture, with the stock often experiencing significant, though not always immediately positive, movements following its reports.

Historically, NVIDIA has demonstrated a strong track record of exceeding analyst expectations, beating Wall Street's earnings estimates in 11 out of the last 12 quarters. However, the stock's immediate reaction to these beats has been mixed. While NVDA shares have moved higher on the first day of trading after earnings in 8 of the last 12 reports, averaging a 4.4% gain, the stock has also shown a tendency to trade lower on the first day, with an average loss of -1.0% over the same period, suggesting that while positive moves can be substantial, negative reactions are also frequent.

Over a slightly longer horizon, more noticeable shifts in share price occur within the one-week period following earnings announcements, with significant positive movements in some quarters and declines in others, such as a 10% decrease in Q3 FY2022. The most substantial changes in NVIDIA's share price are typically observed one month after earnings, with notable periods showing significant gains, including approximately 50% in Q4 FY2020 and 35% in Q2 FY2022, indicating strong investor confidence in the company's long-term outlook despite short-term volatility. Looking at the last three years, the stock has experienced an average move of 13.2% in either direction over the 28 sessions following its earnings reports, excluding the day-after move.

For the upcoming earnings, options markets are pricing in an implied movement of approximately 6% in either direction, which is below the long-term average implied movement of 7.7% over the past 12 quarters. Despite this, traders have been actively loading up on September puts and calls, leading to a sharp increase in implied volatility. Interestingly, the options market has historically overestimated NVDA's earnings move 67% of the time in the last 12 quarters, predicting an average move of ±8.1% against an actual average move of 7.6%.

Recent history suggests a potential downside bias, as the stock has fallen at least 6% twice in the past four quarters, eked out a gain once, and rose 3.3% in another instance. Analysts generally expect NVIDIA to continue its trend of low-balling guidance and then exceeding the upper end of that range, though the beat was notably smaller in the last quarter.

    *   **Impact:** Medium - Provides context on the frequency of earnings beats, which is high, but also highlights that beats don't always lead to immediate stock appreciation.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that NVIDIA frequently beats estimates, but the specific frequency and the detail about falling shares in some instances might be less emphasized in general narratives.

*   **Snippet:** "NVDA shares have moved higher in the immediate aftermath of earnings 8 out of 12 previous reports. On average the stock moved up 4.4% in the first day of trading after the company reported earnings. Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Behavior After Earnings.

    *   **Source:** NVDA Stock Price Pattern Around Earnings Nvidia | Market Chameleon,
    *   **Impact:** High - This presents a contradictory but crucial detail: while average positive moves are larger, negative moves on day one are more frequent. This is material for short-term trading strategies.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked - The nuance of more frequent negative day-one moves despite a higher average positive move is likely non-consensus.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia's options implied a movement of around 6% swing in either direction, which is now below the long-term earnings implied movement of 7.7%, averaged over the last 12 quarters."
    *   **Date:** August 27, 2025
    *   **Source:** Nvidia Technical: Bullish impulsive up move sequence intact ahead of earnings,
    *   **Impact:** Medium - The implied volatility being lower than the historical average could suggest less extreme expectations for the upcoming move, or a potential for a larger surprise if the actual move exceeds this implied value.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked - Specific comparison of current implied move to long-term average implied move is a more detailed analysis than general market sentiment.

*   **Snippet:** "Over the last three years, the stock has seen an average move of 13.2 per cent in either direction over the 28 sessions after its report, not including the day-after move, according to Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. ...

    *   **Source:** Stock market on 'pins and needles' as AI bellwether Nvidia gets set to report earnings,
    *   **Impact:** High - Provides a clear historical average for medium-term movement and highlights a recent trend of downside risk in the last four quarters, which is highly material for current earnings expectations.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known for the average move, but the specific recent downside bias might be overlooked by those focusing only on long-term positive trends.

*   **Snippet:** "The options market overestimated NVDA stocks earnings move 67% of the time in the last 12 quarters. Predicted move after earnings announcement was ±8.1% on average vs an average of the actual earnings moves of 7.6% (in absolute terms)."
    *   **Date:** Not explicitly stated for this specific snippet, but the article was published within the last 3 months.

    *   **Impact:** Medium - Suggests that options premiums might often be inflated relative to the actual post-earnings movement, which is relevant for options traders.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked - This specific statistical detail about options market overestimation is likely non-consensus.

*   **Snippet:** "By now, everyone is probably aware that Nvidia tends to low-ball its guidance and then exceed the upper end of that range by $1 to $2 billion every quarter. Although last quarter, the beat was much smaller, at just $202 million."
    *   **Date:** August 24, 2025
    *   **Source:** Nvidia's Earnings Report Looks Like A Huge Gamble (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha,
    *   **Impact:** High - This pattern of low-balling guidance and then beating it is a key factor in how the market reacts. The smaller beat last quarter could indicate a shift or higher baseline expectations, which is material.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that NVIDIA often beats guidance, but the detail about the *smaller* beat last quarter and its implications might be less universally considered.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Day-one stock movement:** There's a slight contradiction in the immediate aftermath of earnings. One source states NVDA moved higher in 8 of 12 reports with an average +4.4% gain, but then states it's "more likely to trade lower 1 day after earnings for an average loss of -1.0%." This suggests that while positive moves are larger on average, negative moves might occur more frequently.
*   **Implied Volatility:** One source indicates a 6% implied swing, while another mentions +/-8%. While both are within a reasonable range, the slight difference could be due to different methodologies or specific options analyzed.
*   **Non-consensus information about *upcoming* earnings:** The research query focused on historical correlation. While the findings provide valuable context on market behavior, they do not directly offer "material, non-consensus information" about NVIDIA's *specific performance* for Q2 FY2026 or its forward-looking guidance. The snippets primarily analyze past reactions and current market sentiment around the earnings event, rather than uncovering new data points on demand, supply, or competitive landscape for the current quarter. To find such non-consensus information, further targeted research queries focusing on supply chain, channel checks, or niche industry reports would be necessary.
