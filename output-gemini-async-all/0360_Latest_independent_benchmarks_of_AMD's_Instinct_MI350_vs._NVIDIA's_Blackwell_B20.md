## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is facing increasing competitive pressure from AMD's Instinct MI350 series, particularly the MI355X and MI350X, which appear to offer a compelling price-performance proposition and superior memory capacity for large AI models. While NVIDIA's Blackwell B200 maintains strong compute performance and energy efficiency, AMD's aggressive pricing and advancements in its ROCm software stack could lead to market share shifts, especially among hyperscalers and enterprises focused on cost-effective AI deployments. However, some older reports suggest potential accuracy issues with AMD's software, which could be a mitigating factor.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: AMD MI350 Series Offers Significant Price Advantage and Cost-Performance Gap**

*   **Snippet:** "AMD's Instinct MI350 graphics accelerator has entered the AI GPU landscape at a net transaction cost of $25,000 after accounting for a standard 12 percent deduction from the reported sticker price. This strategic pricing places the MI350 solidly below Nvidia's B200, which commands over $35,000, effectively carving out roughly a 30 percent cost-performance gap in AMD's favor. For enterprises scaling out deep learning clusters, that price differential can translate into substantial savings across large-scale deployments."

**Finding 2: AMD MI350 Series Boasts Superior Memory Capacity and Competitive Bandwidth**

*   **Snippet:** "The MI355X and MI350X both feature 288 GB of HBM3e memory, which is higher than the 256-GB capacity of its MI325X and roughly 60 percent higher than the capacity of Nvidia's B200 GPU and GB200 Superchip, according to AMD. The company said this allows each GPU to support an AI model with up to 520 billion parameters on a single chip. The memory bandwidth for both GPUs is 8 TBps, which it said is the same as the B200 and GB200."
*   **Date:** June 12, 2025
*   **Source:** CRN, [https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/amd-instinct-mi350-gpus-memory-edge-to-best-nvidia-s-fastest-ai-chips](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/amd-instinct-mi350-gpus-memory-edge-to-best-nvidia-s-fastest-ai-chips)
*   **Impact:** High. Higher memory capacity (288GB vs. 180GB for B200) is a critical advantage for training and running larger AI models, potentially drawing customers who prioritize model size and complexity. While bandwidth is stated as similar, the capacity difference is significant. This could lead to customers opting for AMD for specific memory-intensive workloads.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA's memory capacity is known, the 60% higher capacity of AMD's MI350 series and its implication for supporting larger models on a single chip might not be fully appreciated by the market, which often focuses on raw TFLOPS.

**Finding 3: AMD MI355X Shows Strong Inference Performance, Outpacing B200 in Specific LLM Tasks**

*   **Snippet:** "Some specific comparisons have emerged via industry reports: an HSBC analysis cited by the media noted that MI355X outpaces NVIDIA's B200 in certain large-model inference tasks – approximately 20% faster on a DeepSeek R1 FP4 workload, and 30% faster on a Llama 3.1-405B LLM test (matching the performance of NVIDIA's massive GB200 system) smbom.com smbom.com. These are bold claims that suggest AMD is competitive at the bleeding edge of LLM inference."
*   **Date:** August 5, 2025
*   **Source:** TS2 Space, [https://ts2.space/en/nvidia-blackwell-b200-vs-amd-mi350-vs-google-tpu-v6e-2025s-ultimate-ai-accelerator-showdown/](https://ts2.space/en/nvidia-blackwell-b200-vs-amd-mi350-vs-google-tpu-v6e-2025s-ultimate-ai-accelerator-showdown/)
*   **Impact:** High. Specific, quantifiable performance leads in key large language model (LLM) inference tasks, even matching NVIDIA's GB200 system in one instance, directly challenges NVIDIA's perceived performance dominance. This could influence purchasing decisions for customers focused on LLM deployment.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA is generally seen as the performance leader, these specific benchmarks showing AMD's lead in critical LLM inference scenarios, particularly from an HSBC analysis, could be non-consensus and impact investor perception of NVIDIA's competitive moat.

**Finding 4: AMD Claims Parity or Slight Lead in AI Training and Significant FP64 Advantage**

*   **Snippet:** "As for training, AMD said the MI355X is roughly on par with the B200 for 70-billion-parameter and 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 models." and "The MI355X can also perform... 79 teraflops of 64-bit floating point (FP64), which it said is double that of the GB200 and B200."
*   **Date:** June 12, 2025
*   **Source:** CRN, [https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/amd-instinct-mi350-gpus-memory-edge-to-best-nvidia-s-fastest-ai-chips](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/amd-instinct-mi350-gpus-memory-edge-to-best-nvidia-s-fastest-ai-chips)
*   **Impact:** Medium. Parity in training performance for common LLMs, combined with a significant lead in FP64 (crucial for HPC and scientific computing), broadens AMD's appeal beyond just inference. This could enable AMD to capture a more diverse set of AI and HPC workloads.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. NVIDIA is often assumed to have a clear lead in all aspects of AI performance. Claims of parity in training and a double advantage in FP64 for AMD could be non-consensus and challenge that assumption.

**Finding 6: Potential Accuracy Issues with AMD's ROCm (Older Report)**

*   **Snippet:** "In terms of nightly accuracy, AMD had ZERO accuracy tests until SemiAnalysis pointed out accuracy issues three weeks ago. For most models, we observe worse accuracy quality on AMD when compared to using NVIDIA. 25% of the tested models are failing accuracy tests when run on AMD. This means that using the same model on ROCm, you get dumber answers than what you would get on NVIDIA. AMD needs to task more 996 engineers to fix this immediately!"

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Memory Bandwidth Discrepancy:** There's a notable contradiction regarding AMD MI355X's memory bandwidth. Some sources claim 8 TB/s (on par with B200), while others state 22.1 TB/s (nearly triple B200's 8 TB/s). This significant difference impacts the perception of AMD's memory subsystem advantage.
*   **Independent Benchmarks:** Most performance claims are either directly from AMD or analyses based on AMD's stated figures. Truly independent, third-party benchmarks across a broad range of AI models and workloads are still somewhat limited. The May 2025 benchmark showed B200 dominating LLaMA 70B, which contrasts with AMD's later claims of parity or lead in other LLM inference tasks.
*   **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** While price is a major factor, a comprehensive TCO analysis that includes power consumption, cooling requirements, and the long-term impact of software ecosystem differences (e.g., developer productivity, debugging) is not fully detailed in the provided snippets.
*   **Power Efficiency:** Both companies make claims about energy efficiency, but direct, independent comparative data on performance per watt for MI350 vs. B200 is not extensively available in these results.
