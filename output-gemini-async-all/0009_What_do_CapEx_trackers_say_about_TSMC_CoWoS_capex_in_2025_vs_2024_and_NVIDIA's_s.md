## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding TSMC's CoWoS CapEx and NVIDIA's allocation has been extracted from recent web content (published within the last 3 months). This information is likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The landscape for advanced packaging, particularly TSMC's CoWoS technology, remains a critical determinant for NVIDIA's AI chip supply. While there's a strong consensus on significant CoWoS capacity expansion and increasing capital expenditure by TSMC, some recent reports introduce potentially non-consensus views and crucial details.

TSMC's overall capital expenditure is projected to increase substantially in 2025, with estimates ranging from $38 billion to $42 billion, up from approximately $32 billion in 2024. A significant portion, around 10-20%, is earmarked for advanced packaging like CoWoS. Global CoWoS demand is expected to surge, with forecasts indicating an increase from 370,000 wafers in 2024 to 670,000 in 2025 and reaching 1 million in 2026, representing an 81% growth in 2025. NVIDIA is consistently cited as the dominant player, projected to secure around 60% of the global CoWoS demand by 2026, translating to roughly 595,000 wafers, with the majority coming from TSMC.

However, a notable non-consensus report suggests that TSMC's CoWoS capacity utilization is currently only at 60%, leading to confusion in the supply chain. This could imply that while capacity is expanding rapidly, actual demand fulfillment or immediate ramp-up might be facing short-term adjustments or that TSMC's expansion is outpacing current immediate demand. This contrasts with the prevailing narrative of persistent bottlenecks, although TSMC itself has admitted that AI chip output will remain constrained through 2025.

Another critical, albeit denied, non-consensus point is the rumor of a potential delay in mass production for NVIDIA's next-generation Rubin GPU due to redesigns. While NVIDIA has refuted this, any such delay could impact future revenue streams and product transitions. Furthermore, one brokerage note suggests that incremental CoWoS capacity additions (excluding OSATs) might decline in 2026 and remain muted in 2027 before a larger ramp-up for Rubin Ultra in 2028, which could temper expectations for continuous, aggressive CoWoS supply growth in the immediate out-years.

Overall, while NVIDIA's long-term CoWoS allocation appears robust, the near-term picture presents a mix of aggressive capacity expansion, potential underutilization, and a critical rumor about its next-gen product, all of which could influence investor sentiment and earnings guidance.

### Structured Findings

**1. TSMC's CoWoS Capacity Growth and NVIDIA's Dominant Share**

*   **Snippet:** "The report predicts that global CoWoS demand will rise from 370,000 wafers in 2024 to 670,000 in 2025, and reach 1 million in 2026. This implies a 40%-50% year-over-year growth in the cloud AI semiconductor market in 2026. ... NVIDIA leads the pack, securing 60% of CoWoS capacity ... The report predicts that by 2026, NVIDIA's total demand for CoWoS wafers will reach 595,000, accounting for 60% of the global total. Of this substantial order, approximately 510,000 wafers will be handled by Taiwan Semiconductor, primarily for the CoWoS-L technology required for its next-generation Rubin architecture chips."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-29
*   **Source:** Zephyr Trading Desk, citing Morgan Stanley research report.
*   **Impact:** High. This provides concrete, forward-looking data on the overall CoWoS market growth and NVIDIA's substantial, long-term allocation, directly impacting NVIDIA's ability to meet future demand for its AI accelerators.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that NVIDIA is a major CoWoS consumer, but the specific numbers for global demand and NVIDIA's 60% share by 2026 are detailed and valuable.

**2. Reported 60% CoWoS Capacity Utilization Amidst AI Boom**

*   **Snippet:** "Reports have emerged that TSMC's advanced packaging technology, CoWoS, is operating at only 60% capacity utilization. Such a supply-demand mismatch has confused the supply chain. ... Supply chain insiders suggest this situation may stem from TSMC's rapid expansion outpacing actual demand or possible short-term adjustments in wafer starts from Nvidia and other ASIC clients."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-05
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (original publication not explicitly named in snippet, but context suggests industry report).
*   **Impact:** High. If true and persistent, this is a significant non-consensus data point. It contradicts the narrative of severe, unresolvable CoWoS bottlenecks and could imply either a temporary oversupply relative to immediate demand or short-term order adjustments from key clients like NVIDIA, potentially impacting NVIDIA's near-term revenue or inventory management.
*   **Consensus Check:** Highly overlooked/non-consensus. The prevailing market view is that CoWoS capacity is a major bottleneck. This suggests a potential easing or a different dynamic.

**3. TSMC's Increased CapEx for 2025 and Persistent Constraints**

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC admits AI chip output will remain constrained through 2025, with delays pushing back shipments for major clients like NVIDIA. This tightness is compounded by rising costs: TSMC's capital expenditures are set to hit $38 billion in 2025, up from $32 billion in 2024, as it races to expand factories in Taiwan, Arizona, and Japan."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-21
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (original publication not explicitly named in snippet, but context suggests industry report).
*   **Impact:** Medium. The increased CapEx signals TSMC's commitment to expand, which is positive for NVIDIA long-term. However, the admission of continued constraints through 2025 indicates that despite the investment, supply may not fully meet demand in the immediate future, potentially limiting NVIDIA's upside.
*   **Consensus Check:** Generally known that TSMC is increasing CapEx and that AI chip supply is tight, but the specific CapEx figures and the explicit admission of constraints through 2025 are important details.

**4. Rumored Delay of NVIDIA's Rubin GPU and Capacity Share Shifts**

*   **Snippet:** "Rumors suggest that Nvidia's next-generation graphics processor Rubin may be delayed in mass production. ... 'We believe Rubin is likely to be delayed,' Fubon Financial analyst Sherman Shang said in a research note. 'The first version of Rubin taped out at the end of June, but Nvidia is currently redesigning the chip to better match AMD's upcoming MI450.' However, Nvidia denied any delays to Rubin's timeline. ... by 2025, Nvidia will still hold a 51.4% capacity share, compared to Broadcom's 16.2% and AMD's 7.7%. However, by 2026, Broadcom and AMD's capacity allocation is expected to reach 17.4% and 9.2%, respectively, while Nvidia's capacity allocation will decline slightly to 50.1%."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-14
*   **Source:** EEWORLD, citing Fubon Financial analyst Sherman Shang and Nomad Semi analyst Moore Morris.
*   **Impact:** High. A delay in Rubin, even if denied, could significantly impact NVIDIA's product roadmap, competitive positioning against AMD, and future revenue guidance. The specific capacity share figures for 2025 and 2026, showing a slight decline for NVIDIA, are also material for understanding competitive dynamics.
*   **Consensus Check:** Highly non-consensus due to the denial from NVIDIA. The specific capacity share breakdown is also more granular than widely published figures.

**5. Goldman Sachs Upward Revision of TSMC CoWoS Shipments and CapEx**

*   **Snippet:** "Goldman Sachs significantly raised its forecast for TSMC's CoWoS (chip on wafer on substrate) shipments to 664,000 units in 2025, 1,080,000 in 2026, and 1,566,000 in 2027. Previous estimates were 585,000, 923,000, and 1,287,000 units respectively. ... Goldman Sachs also increased its capital expenditure forecasts for TSMC to $42 billion in 2026 and $50 billion in 2027, up from previous estimates of $40 billion and $48 billion, reflecting a more positive outlook on CoWoS expansion."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-25
*   **Source:** Investing.com, citing Goldman Sachs.
*   **Impact:** Medium. This upward revision from a major investment bank indicates stronger-than-previously-expected CoWoS supply growth, which is positive for NVIDIA's ability to scale. The increased CapEx forecasts for 2026 and 2027 further support this.
*   **Consensus Check:** Represents a revised, more optimistic view from a major brokerage, potentially ahead of broader market consensus.

**6. Contradictory View on Future Incremental CoWoS Capacity Additions**

*   **Snippet:** "We forecast TSMC CapEx should grow from $40B in 2025 to $45B in 2026 and $50B in 2027. ... We see incremental CoWoS capacity (ex-OSAT) additions to decline in '26 and remain muted in '27, before 9.5x reticle CoWoS fully ramps up to support Rubin Ultra in '28."
*   **Date:** 2025-07-12
*   **Source:** Tech Investments.
*   **Impact:** Medium. This snippet presents a potentially non-consensus view that incremental CoWoS capacity additions might slow down in 2026-2027, despite overall CapEx growth. This could imply a temporary plateau in CoWoS supply growth before a larger leap with Rubin Ultra in 2028, potentially affecting NVIDIA's ability to scale production in the intermediate term.
*   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus, as it contradicts the general expectation of continuous, aggressive CoWoS expansion year-over-year.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **CoWoS Capacity Utilization vs. Bottlenecks:** Snippet reports 60% CoWoS capacity utilization, suggesting a potential easing or oversupply, which directly contradicts the narrative of persistent bottlenecks and constraints through 2025 mentioned in snippets and. This is a significant contradiction that needs further investigation.
*   **TSMC 2025 CapEx Figures:** While most sources converge on $38-42 billion for TSMC's 2025 CapEx, snippet mentions $32-36 billion for 2025, which is a lower range.
*   **NVIDIA's 2026 CoWoS Allocation:** Snippet states NVIDIA will secure 595,000 CoWoS wafers by 2026 (60% of global demand), while snippet states NVIDIA's 2026 TSMC allocation is 480,000 wafers. The difference could be due to non-TSMC suppliers or different forecasting methodologies, but it's a gap in consistent numbers.
*   **Rubin Delay:** The rumor of Rubin delay is a significant non-consensus point, especially given NVIDIA's denial. The actual status of Rubin's production timeline remains a critical unknown.
*   **Incremental CoWoS Additions:** The view that incremental CoWoS capacity additions might decline in 2026-2027 contradicts the general expectation of continuous ramp-up, creating uncertainty about the mid-term supply trajectory.
