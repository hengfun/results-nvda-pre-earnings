## Analysis

.

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have focused on extracting material, non-consensus information regarding Blackwell-ready server designs from major OEMs, with a strict filter for web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025). NVIDIA reports earnings for Q2 FY2026 (quarter ending July 2025) after market close today.

The research reveals a mixed but generally positive picture for Blackwell's near-term adoption, with some lingering concerns about initial ramp-up challenges being addressed. A key non-consensus element is the ongoing discussion around early production hurdles and a strategic shift in Blackwell product offerings, juxtaposed with strong recent announcements of broad OEM and enterprise adoption.

### Human-Readable Analysis

Recent reports indicate a significant push by NVIDIA and its partners to bring Blackwell-powered servers to market. The newly launched NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers, featuring the Blackwell architecture, are seeing broad adoption from major OEMs like Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, as well as partners such as Advantech, ASUS, Compal, Foxconn, PEGATRON, and Wiwynn. Several prominent enterprises, including Disney, Foxconn, Hitachi Ltd., Hyundai Motor Group, Lilly, SAP, and TSMC, are already deploying these RTX PRO Servers to accelerate AI, design, and simulation workloads. Cloud providers like CoreWeave and Google Cloud are offering Blackwell-powered RTX PRO instances, with AWS, Nebius, and Vultr planning expansions. Dell, for instance, is updating its AI Data Platform to incorporate NVIDIA's design, with its PowerEdge R7725 servers featuring two RTX PRO 6000 GPUs.

However, there have been underlying reports of challenges impacting the initial high-volume production of the more advanced Blackwell chips (B100, B200, GB200). Some sources suggest that NVIDIA's Blackwell family has encountered "major issues" in reaching high-volume production, impacting targets for Q3/Q4 2024 and the first half of next year. These issues are reportedly linked to NVIDIA's design of the Blackwell architecture and packaging challenges with TSMC's CoWoS-L technology. This has led to expectations of fewer shipments and a pushout of GB200 NVL72 and HGX B100/B200, with a potential shift towards more Hopper shipments in late 2024 and early 2025. Foxconn, a key server manufacturer, confirmed limited availability of Blackwell GPUs this year, stating that it would rely on existing Hopper-powered machines to meet sales targets due to high AI server demand. NVIDIA is reportedly introducing a B200A GPU, based on the B102 die, which can be packaged on CoWoS-S, potentially to address these supply constraints for lower-end and mid-range AI systems.

Despite these reported production hurdles, more recent reports from July and August 2025 indicate a ramp-up in shipments of new Blackwell-based platforms, such as the NVIDIA GB200 rack and HGX B200, starting in Q2. TrendForce projects that Blackwell GPUs will account for over 80% of NVIDIA's high-end GPU shipments in 2025. Key ODMs like Foxconn, Supermicro, and Quanta are seeing significant order growth, with Supermicro securing several GB200 rack projects and Quanta expanding its GB200/GB300 rack operations, including new orders from Oracle. Supermicro also expanded its AI portfolio for the European market with over 30 Blackwell-tailored solutions and is seeing a significant increase in demand for direct liquid cooling servers, which are critical for Blackwell.

The contradiction lies between earlier reports of significant production delays and design issues for the high-end Blackwell chips (B100, B200, GB200) and the very recent announcements of broad OEM support, enterprise adoption, and a projected ramp-up in Q2 shipments for Blackwell platforms. It appears NVIDIA is actively addressing these challenges, potentially through product diversification (e.g., B200A) and leveraging its extensive partner ecosystem. The strong demand for liquid cooling solutions further underscores the market's readiness for high-power Blackwell systems, even amidst initial supply complexities.

### Structured Findings

**Finding 1:** Broad OEM and Enterprise Adoption of NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers (Blackwell-powered)
*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA today announced leading global enterprises have adopted NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers — a new category of enterprise data center infrastructure powered by the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU — speeding the shift from general-purpose computing clusters to AI factory infrastructure, without a complete data center overhaul. Disney, Foxconn, Hitachi Ltd., Hyundai Motor Group, Lilly, SAP and TSMC are among the first to adopt the servers to accelerate AI, design and simulation applications."

*   **Impact:** High. This is very recent and indicates strong market acceptance and readiness for Blackwell in enterprise settings, which could drive significant revenue. The specific mention of major enterprises and OEMs (Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Advantech, ASUS, Compal, Foxconn, PEGATRON, Wiwynn) suggests a robust ecosystem.
*   **Consensus Check:** This information, being released just days before earnings, might not be fully priced into consensus estimates, especially the breadth of enterprise adoption.

**Finding 2:** Reported Production Issues and Strategic Product Shift for High-End Blackwell
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia's Blackwell family is encountering major issues in reaching high volume production. This setback has impacted their production targets for Q3/Q4 2024 as well as the first half of next year. The core issue impacting shipments is directly related to Nvidia's design of the Blackwell architecture. The supply of the original Blackwell package is limited due to packaging issues at TSMC and with Nvidia's design. HGX Blackwell servers will still be bought by hyperscalers... but it will be purchased in much lower volume than before. We expect fewer shipments / pushout of GB200 NVL72 / 36×2 and a dramatic reduction in volume for B100 & B200 HGX. Instead, we expect more shipments of Hopper in 4Q 2024 to 1Q 2025. To satisfy demand, Nvidia will now be introducing a Blackwell GPU called the B200A based on the B102 die... Importantly, this allows the chip to be packaged on CoWoS-S instead of CoWoS-L..."
*   **Date:** August 4, 2024
*   **Source:** SemiAnalysis, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHgIYYkfuQzlUkwaRBGfeXzSVk6LF1IYCLY78rq8SpWgI2gMClV0B1ruGKDxmAoSkmdR0utJKks6ua_3XL005_D6Bb41t7bivwT_hd957tnnGFrt3lWcmb7nQQBMPDlQ_D-5C42OSkg_6q69CH4RlMLWp8cWFOlu2Gn3SLrN9BCEZYH
*   **Impact:** High. This suggests significant headwinds for the initial ramp of the most advanced Blackwell products, potentially leading to lower-than-expected Blackwell revenue in the near term and a reliance on Hopper. The introduction of the B200A as a workaround is a material strategic adjustment.
*   **Consensus Check:** While some rumors of delays have circulated, the detailed technical reasons (CoWoS-L packaging issues) and the specific product shift (B200A replacing B100/B200 HGX) might be non-consensus or not fully appreciated by the broader market. This contradicts the more optimistic tone of the RTX PRO server adoption.

**Finding 3:** Foxconn Confirms Limited Blackwell Availability in 2024, Relies on Hopper
*   **Snippet:** "Foxconn has confirmed that its first servers based on Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs will be available this year. However, they will only be available in low quantities. The company stressed that even if it cannot ship GB200-based machines in sizeable quantities this year, demand for AI servers is so high that it will meet its sales targets by selling existing Nvidia Hopper-powered machines."
*   **Date:** August 14, 2024
*   **Source:** Tom's Hardware, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFflzmWEQuhu0yFHH_LoxGRUTEY6OMKJaUtOPUcYbiT6t7hGV_cC9jbD5f1mS7b18wasTjdVSVIOguW3LVKoAToE65rlxfcz0dsHxlvIGlO51PJr4ykkoIafzd2pvgom0wtNb62LSpCO8IHYOjCDIR7bV9qUdH5jf19nA8MQZhELMo5ti8XO6D45KCWU1BP5zIExQ31yEsTr1kTzD5huqGE6zLiuP12DwgFyKvDFb1G6MOc7jANLbGf10Y2kAqbR9VeVQy7VnO_
*   **Impact:** Medium-High. This corroborates the delay narrative from a major OEM, indicating that the Blackwell ramp might be slower than some anticipate, with Hopper filling the gap. This could temper expectations for Blackwell's immediate revenue contribution.
*   **Consensus Check:** While general awareness of a transition exists, the explicit confirmation from a major OEM about "low quantities" and reliance on Hopper for 2024 sales targets could be a non-consensus detail.

**Finding 4:** Blackwell Shipments Ramping in Q2 FY2026, Strong 2025 Projections from TrendForce
*   **Snippet:** "TrendForce's latest investigations find that the overall server market has recently stabilized, with ODMs concentrating efforts on AI server development. Starting in Q2, shipments of new Blackwell-based platforms—such as the NVIDIA GB200 rack and HGX B200—have gradually ramped up, while next-generation B300 and GB300 series products have entered the sampling and validation phase. TrendForce projects that Blackwell GPUs will account for over 80% of NVIDIA's high-end GPU shipments in 2025."
*   **Date:** July 24, 2025
*   **Source:** TrendForce, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEJCTUWYpZnLToGahfOb4o4AdBUczzgOg0TNfxvQgNvfRfbSN5daePsWCvY5LX9Mick_pzWpFdf5trN4Letfi-X0t4eI8Lzf0ZcxeX6fPgoc18aQxkWz2NCOH5ym2tqXSzAoNfrPwI-MGXltD_9_xkFBiiYbFe7-Vj-
*   **Impact:** High. This is a very positive and timely data point, directly addressing the Q2 FY2026 period. It suggests that despite earlier challenges, Blackwell shipments are indeed ramping up, and the long-term outlook for Blackwell dominance in high-end GPUs remains strong. Specific OEM wins for GB200/GB300 racks (Foxconn, Supermicro, Quanta, Wiwynn) are also noted.
*   **Consensus Check:** This provides a strong counter-narrative to the delay reports, suggesting that the ramp-up is now underway. The "gradual ramp-up" in Q2 could be a key detail for earnings guidance.

**Finding 5:** Supermicro's Significant Blackwell Portfolio and Liquid Cooling Demand
*   **Snippet:** "Supermicro (SMCI) plays a pivotal role in deploying Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs into scalable server systems, including air- and liquid-cooled HGX B200 and GB200 NVL72 racks. In 2025, the company expanded its AI portfolio for the European market, introducing 30+ solutions tailored for Blackwell architecture. Its DLC-2 liquid cooling technology, which reduces power and water consumption by 40%, is a key differentiator in energy-efficient AI data centers."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** AInvest, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFdvfuFUvLoKzYSAnxGlRncCsVGjDk5xyy5841LSGFHMktMQPJx54DutNtKLKyzSxI3ezpn12BtF7Q_n_wIpvRVOb9ROKk3xjw9HBqwGKmlrgvdSDnUXD9WBiJF3a8q8CDxnb1uRGm7nGUEE01CiKolIWQT0V5tjnfd52daoU62deL2k5CzaAmn64MfVbpZB5vcckhP7CWckg1_TpXDl4cYlABHpvfOYaicLg38qUcuSkITFfmbER0txGwggndTJ2d-_F05RaeqDi_pxcv73v5
*   **Impact:** Medium-High. Supermicro is a critical partner, and their extensive Blackwell-ready offerings (30+ solutions) and expertise in liquid cooling are crucial for the deployment of high-density Blackwell systems. The soaring demand for liquid cooling noted by Supermicro management (from 1% to 15% of new servers in June/July, projected to 30% by year-end) further highlights the readiness of the infrastructure for Blackwell.
*   **Consensus Check:** While Supermicro's role is known, the specific number of Blackwell solutions for Europe and the rapid increase in liquid cooling adoption provide concrete, potentially non-consensus data points on the ecosystem's readiness.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradiction:** The reports of "major issues" and "limited availability" for high-end Blackwell chips (B100, B200, GB200) contrast with the very recent announcements of broad OEM adoption and a "gradual ramp-up" of Blackwell platforms in Q2, along with strong 2025 projections. This suggests that while initial challenges existed, NVIDIA and its supply chain are actively overcoming them, or that the "RTX PRO Servers" represent a more readily available segment of the Blackwell family.
*   **Gap:** While we have information on the *number* of OEMs supporting Blackwell-ready designs and some early adopters, specific *volume* numbers for Blackwell server shipments in Q2 FY2026 from these OEMs are not explicitly stated, beyond the general "gradual ramp-up." The impact of the B200A on overall Blackwell volumes and revenue mix for Q2 is also not fully detailed.
