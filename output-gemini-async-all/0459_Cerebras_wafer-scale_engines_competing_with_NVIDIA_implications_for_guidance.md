## Analysis

Based on the provided search results and strictly adhering to the "last 3 months" filter (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025), there is a notable scarcity of recent, specific, and non-consensus information directly linking Cerebras wafer-scale engines to a material impact on NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. Most of the detailed competitive analysis and Cerebras-specific news (e.g., IPO filings, performance claims, Dell partnership) are dated to late 2024.

The available recent information primarily focuses on NVIDIA's general earnings expectations and market position, with little mention of Cerebras as a significant, immediate threat to NVIDIA's short-term financial outlook within the specified timeframe.

However, to provide some context from the relevant period, here are findings related to NVIDIA's upcoming earnings and market sentiment:

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The market generally anticipates strong Q2 FY2026 results from NVIDIA, driven by continued demand in data centers, despite some deceleration in year-on-year growth compared to previous quarters. Analysts expect NVIDIA's revenue to be around $45.8 billion, with GAAP net income forecast at $23.2 billion. While export restrictions on H20 chips are expected to continue impacting results, a recovery in gross margins to 71.8% is anticipated.

Analyst sentiment remains largely constructive, with a high proportion of "buy" or "strong buy" ratings, reflecting NVIDIA's undisputed leadership in the AI infrastructure market and its robust full-stack ecosystem. Concerns about competition are acknowledged, but NVIDIA's strong moat and continuous innovation, including its upcoming GB200 GPU, are seen as significant advantages. Some analysts note that NVIDIA's Blackwell line is already sold out for the year, suggesting that any potential "upside" might be constrained by capacity rather than demand.

The lack of recent, specific information regarding Cerebras directly impacting NVIDIA's guidance within the last three months suggests that, from the perspective of the provided search results, Cerebras is not currently viewed as a material, non-consensus factor for NVIDIA's immediate earnings or guidance. The competitive landscape is broad, but Cerebras's impact appears to be more of a long-term watch item rather than an immediate earnings driver for NVIDIA.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Analysts expect Q2 revenue of $45.8 billion, representing 52.4% year-on-year (YoY) growth, which is a significant deceleration from previous quarters. NVIDIA's guidance suggests revenue between $44.1 billion and $45.9 billion. GAAP net income is forecast at $23.2 billion, marking a 39.6% growth versus the prior year. Export restrictions on H20 chips will continue impacting Q2 results. While gross margins suffered significantly last quarter, recovery to 71.8% is anticipated as management targets mid-70% margins despite operational headwinds."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This provides the consensus expectation for NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings, which is the baseline against which any non-consensus information would be measured. It highlights expected growth deceleration and margin recovery.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. These are analyst consensus estimates and NVIDIA's own guidance, forming the market's baseline expectation.

*   **Snippet:** "Despite the competition, analysts estimate that NVIDIA holds a market share of 80% to 92% in data centers for GPUs. There is little doubt that the company currently holds undisputed leadership in the AI infrastructure market, which is potentially worth trillions if Jensen Huang's vision for AI reaching every major market comes to fruition."

    *   **Impact:** Low. This reinforces NVIDIA's dominant market position, which is a widely accepted view. It provides context but does not introduce non-consensus information regarding Cerebras.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. NVIDIA's market dominance is a well-established fact in the industry.

*   **Snippet:** "Seaport Research hitting Nvidia with the rare cell rating as it initiates coverage on semiconductors seapport noting AI is bringing about a secular shift in the industry jay Goldberg senior analyst at Seapport Research Partners joining us now to discuss this jay it is great to have you here so you initiate Nvidia with a cell uh you might Jay per Bloomberg be the only cell on on the street. explain the rate rating to us Jay. great great thanks for having me. so put simply I think the AI story we've been talking about it for years we all know about it it's fully priced in to Nvidia. right now they're a good company they make great products. but they've said already their newest line of products their Blackwell. line is sold out for the year they're capacity constrained. once you're sold out the cap the room for upside is is pretty minimal the bias shifts towards the downside."

    *   **Source:** Nvidia gets a rare Sell rating, analyst explains why, YouTube (Yahoo Finance), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGEgdw9_FEZ4cfdvWLb3UcVwWtl_zgbxUSEBEecJpike1bwuXbze2dgCNlNBKWbXZT0d6IfgvooCu_7LGt7bdq7y_tk7DOW7cwQIm9e-Mq5FMI33YPivGDqXVWIt15p_ufRxBzUYA==
    *   **Impact:** Low (for Cerebras competition). While this is a "non-consensus" rating (Sell), the reasoning provided focuses on NVIDIA's valuation and capacity constraints for Blackwell, not direct competition from Cerebras. The date is also slightly outside the 3-month window (May 27, 2025).
    *   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus (the "Sell" rating itself), but the reasoning doesn't directly address Cerebras as a competitive threat impacting guidance.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** There are no direct contradictions within the *recent* search results regarding Cerebras's impact on NVIDIA's guidance, primarily because Cerebras is barely mentioned in the recent NVIDIA-focused earnings previews.
*   **Gaps:** The most significant gap is the lack of recent, specific information (within the last 3 months) directly addressing Cerebras's wafer-scale engines as a material, non-consensus factor for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings or forward-looking guidance. While older articles (late 2024) discuss Cerebras's competitive claims and growth, this information falls outside the requested timeframe, making it difficult to assess its *immediate* impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 results. The search results do not provide any recent supply chain reports, niche publications, or partner disclosures that highlight Cerebras as a significant, near-term threat to NVIDIA's financial performance.
