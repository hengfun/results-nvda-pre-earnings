## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY226 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a key area of focus for investors and analysts is the company's ability to navigate the escalating thermal management challenges posed by its increasingly powerful AI GPUs. While the high power consumption of NVIDIA's latest chips is widely acknowledged, recent reports from niche publications and industry research firms shed light on the rapid acceleration of liquid cooling adoption, specific supply chain developments, and the tangible cost implications for data center operators. This non-consensus information could materially impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: Accelerated Liquid Cooling Adoption Driven by NVIDIA's Blackwell and Rubin Architectures**

*   **Snippet:** "TrendForce's latest research on the liquid cooling industry reveals that the rollout of NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72 rack servers in 2025 will accelerate AI data center upgrades, driving liquid cooling adoption from early pilot projects to large-scale deployment. Penetration in AI data centers is projected to surge from 14% in 2024 to 33% in 2025, with continued growth in the following years. TrendForce notes that power consumption for GPUs and ASIC chips in AI servers has risen sharply. For example, NVIDIA's GB200/GB300 NVL72 systems have a TDP of 130–140 kW per rack, far exceeding the limits of traditional air-cooling systems."
*   **Snippet:** "TrendForce's latest investigations find that the overall server market has recently stabilized, with ODMs concentrating efforts on AI server development. Starting in Q2, shipments of new Blackwell-based platforms—such as the NVIDIA GB200 rack and HGX B200—have gradually ramped up, while next-generation B300 and GB300 series products have entered the sampling and validation phase. TrendForce projects that Blackwell GPUs will account for over 80% of NVIDIA's high-end GPU shipments in 2025."

*   **Date:** August 21, 2025, July 24, 2025, August 19, 2025
*   **Source:** TrendForce, I-Connect007, Guohai Securities (via Zhitong Finance APP)
*   **Impact:** High. This information directly indicates a significant ramp-up of NVIDIA's most advanced, liquid-cooled Blackwell platforms (GB200/GB300) in Q2 FY2026. The projected surge in liquid cooling penetration in AI data centers from 14% in 2024 to 33% in 2025, driven by these NVIDIA products, suggests robust demand and successful deployment of high-density AI workloads. This could lead to higher-than-expected data center revenue and positive forward-looking guidance, as the necessity of liquid cooling for these high-TDP systems reinforces NVIDIA's ecosystem advantage.
*   **Consensus Check:** While the general trend towards liquid cooling for AI is known, the specific projections for penetration rates in 2025, the direct linkage to NVIDIA's GB200/GB300 and Rubin architectures, and the Q2 ramp-up of Blackwell shipments are more granular than widely understood by the broader market. The projection that Blackwell GPUs will account for over 80% of NVIDIA's high-end GPU shipments in 2025 is a strong, specific indicator.

**Finding 2: AWS's Custom Liquid Cooling Solution for NVIDIA AI GPUs Enabling Rapid Deployment**

*   **Snippet:** "AWS is developing hardware to support cooling functions for next-generation NVIDIA AI GPUs. Problem Solving. NVIDIA's GPUs have been a critical resource in powering the GenAI boom. However, while they are incredibly powerful, they are also very resource-hungry and require separate components for cooling. Instead of resorting to traditional cooling techniques that would consume significant floor space and water, Amazon engineers devised a novel liquid cooling solution: the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX). This custom-built solution for NVIDIA AI GPUs allows AWS to revolutionize the housing and cooling of these chips, integrating the system into both existing and new data centers. Developed in a rapid 11 months in collaboration with NVIDIA, the cooling technology is a testament to the efficiency and agility of the AWS-NVIDIA partnership. The system, which combines liquid and air-based components, circulates coolant to GPU chips through cold plates while removing heat via fan-coil arrays. ... For Amazon, this innovation represents a series of significant wins. The new cooling system designed by AWS has enabled it, among other innovations, to quickly and efficiently make P6e-GB200 UltraServers, powered by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips, generally available."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a specific, positive disclosure from a major hyperscaler (AWS) detailing a successful and rapid (11 months) collaboration with NVIDIA to develop a custom liquid cooling solution for next-generation NVIDIA AI GPUs. Crucially, this innovation enables the "quick and efficient" general availability of P6e-GB200 UltraServers. This suggests that a key customer is effectively overcoming thermal challenges for NVIDIA's latest chips, which could accelerate deployments and revenue recognition for NVIDIA in Q2 and beyond, indicating strong execution and partnership.
*   **Consensus Check:** While general hyperscaler investment in AI infrastructure is known, the specific details of AWS's custom liquid cooling solution for NVIDIA's GB200 and the rapid deployment of these UltraServers are likely non-consensus and provide a concrete, positive signal for NVIDIA's ability to get its most advanced chips into customer hands without significant thermal bottlenecks.

**Finding 3: Specific Supply Chain Players Gaining Advantage in NVIDIA's Liquid Cooling Ecosystem**

*   **Snippet:** "In NVIDIA's GB200 project, international leaders such as CPC, Parker Hannifin, Danfoss, and Staubli have gained an early advantage with proven certifications and high-end application expertise. ... Cold plates, as the core component for direct-contact heat exchange, are supplied by Cooler Master, AVC, BOYD, and Auras. Three of these suppliers (excluding BOYD) have expanded liquid cooling production capacity in SEA to meet strong demand from U.S. CSP clients. Coolant distribution units (CDUs)—the core modules responsible for heat transfer and coolant flow—are generally classified into sidecar and in-row designs. Sidecar CDUs currently dominate the market, led by Delta, while in-row CDUs, supplied primarily by Vertiv and BOYD, offer stronger cooling performance suited for high-density AI rack deployments. Quick disconnects (QD) are critical connectors in liquid cooling systems, ensuring airtightness, pressure resistance, and reliability."
*   **Snippet:** "Liquid cooling is rapidly becoming the standard configuration for high-performance AI data centers, significantly boosting demand for thermal components and accelerating supplier shipments. For example, Fositek has begun shipping NVIDIA QD couplings specifically designed for the GB300 platform, used in conjunction with cold plates developed by its parent company, AVC, for the GB300 NVL72 rack system. Supply chain sources indicate that Fositek has also begun mass production of QDs and floating mount QDs of AWS' ASIC-based liquid cooling systems, and its share of QD supply for this platform is expected to rival that of Danfoss."

**Finding 4: Doubling of Energy Bills for Newer NVIDIA Chips - A Potential Long-Term Headwind**

*   **Snippet:** "Energy bills have roughly doubled when upgrading to newer Nvidia chips, according to Dan Alistarh, a professor at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria who researches algorithm efficiency. 'It's a weird trade-off because you're running things faster, but you're also using more energy,' Alistarh said."
*   **Date:** June 21, 2025
*   **Source:** Quartz
*   **Impact:** Medium-Low for Q2 FY2026 earnings, but potentially High for forward-looking guidance and long-term demand. This quote highlights a significant increase in operational costs for customers adopting newer, more powerful NVIDIA chips. While the immediate demand for performance in AI currently outweighs these cost concerns, a "doubling of energy bills" represents a substantial financial burden for data center operators. This could lead to increased pressure on NVIDIA to deliver even more power-efficient solutions in the future or could accelerate hyperscalers' efforts to develop their own custom, more power-optimized chips. For Q2, it is unlikely to directly impact NVIDIA's revenue or gross margin, but it represents a potential long-term headwind that could be a subtle undercurrent in customer discussions or a point of inquiry during the earnings call regarding sustainability and total cost of ownership.
*   **Consensus Check:** The high power consumption of AI chips is generally known, but a specific statement from an academic researcher about "energy bills roughly doubling" and framing it as a "weird trade-off" might be a more pointed and less widely discussed aspect of the cost implications for customers. This specific observation could be overlooked by some investors focusing solely on performance gains.
