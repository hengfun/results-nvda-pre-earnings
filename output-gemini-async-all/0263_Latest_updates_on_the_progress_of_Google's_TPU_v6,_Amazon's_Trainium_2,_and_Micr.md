## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a review of recent developments in custom AI chips from its major hyperscaler customers—Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—reveals material, non-consensus information that could influence NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance. While Amazon continues to advance its Trainium series, significant delays in Microsoft's Maia 2 chip production and a lack of specific, recent updates on Google's next-generation cloud TPUs suggest a potentially extended reliance on NVIDIA's GPU offerings for these key players.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The most impactful and potentially non-consensus information revolves around Microsoft's in-house AI chip efforts. Multiple reports from June and July 2025 indicate substantial delays for Microsoft's next-generation Maia 2 (codenamed Braga), pushing its mass production from 2025 to 2026. These setbacks are attributed to unexpected design changes, some reportedly requested by OpenAI, as well as staffing constraints and high employee turnover within Microsoft's chip development teams. Crucially, the Maia 2 chip is also expected to underperform NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, which was released in late 2024. This confluence of delays and anticipated performance shortfalls strongly suggests that Microsoft will remain dependent on NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs for a longer period than initially projected, providing a tailwind for NVIDIA's data center revenue.

Amazon, on the other hand, is demonstrating more consistent progress with its custom silicon. Its Trainium 2 chip is already deployed and touted to offer a 30-40% better price-performance ratio than competing GPUs, forming the backbone for Anthropic's Claude models and Amazon's Bedrock platform. Furthermore, Amazon unveiled its next-generation Trainium 3 chip in December, with a release expected later this year. While Amazon's commitment to custom chips poses a long-term competitive threat to NVIDIA's pricing power, the immediate impact on NVIDIA's upcoming earnings may be mitigated by the ongoing demand for NVIDIA's top-tier GPUs for the most intensive AI workloads, especially as Trainium 2/3 ramp-up continues. The recent departure of a key Amazon AI chip executive, while notable, does not appear to derail Amazon's broader custom silicon strategy.

For Google, specific, recent updates on a new generation of its cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPU v6) are less clear. While Google unveiled a "seventh-generation AI chip" in April 2025, designed to speed AI application performance, detailed progress or deployment timelines for a direct successor to the current TPU v5e within the last three months are not readily available. This ambiguity, or lack of explicit new cloud TPU announcements, could imply that Google's internal chip development might not be progressing as rapidly as some might assume, potentially leading to continued or even increased reliance on NVIDIA's GPUs for certain advanced AI workloads in the near term.

In summary, the delays and performance expectations for Microsoft's custom AI chips present a clear positive for NVIDIA's near-to-medium term outlook, potentially extending its dominance in supplying AI infrastructure to a major hyperscaler. Amazon's advancements, while competitive, are a known factor, and the lack of specific, recent news on Google's next-gen cloud TPUs could also indirectly benefit NVIDIA by reducing immediate competitive pressure from that front.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) has pushed back its most ambitious in-house AI chips—codenamed Braga-R and Clea—to 2028 or later, while deferring Maia 200 to 2026 and focusing on interim designs after development delays. Microsoft released its first in-house AI chip, Maia 100, last year and originally slated Maia 200 for 2025. Facing design and tooling hurdles, the company has now moved Maia 200 to 2026."

    *   **Impact:** High. The delay of Microsoft's Maia 200 (Braga) to 2026 means an extended period of reliance on NVIDIA's GPUs for Microsoft's AI infrastructure needs. This directly supports NVIDIA's data center revenue in the near to medium term.
    *   **Consensus Check:** This delay has been reported by several outlets in June/July 2025, moving towards consensus. However, the full implications of extended NVIDIA dependence might still be underappreciated.

*   **Snippet:** "The setback means Microsoft's in-house processor, codenamed Braga, will likely underperform Nvidia's market-leading Blackwell chips when it eventually launches, potentially extending the software giant's dependence on third-party AI hardware, suggests a report by Reuters on the matter."

    *   **Impact:** High. The anticipated underperformance of Maia 200 against NVIDIA's Blackwell chips further solidifies NVIDIA's competitive advantage and ensures continued demand for its superior hardware, even after Microsoft's custom chip eventually launches.
    *   **Consensus Check:** While the delay is becoming known, the specific detail of underperformance against Blackwell might be less widely factored into market expectations for NVIDIA's sustained growth.

*   **Snippet:** "Microsoft made unanticipated design revisions, some at the request of OpenAI, which introduced instability during simulations and set the project back by several months. The refusal of Microsoft executives to adjust project deadlines despite mounting challenges led to high stress among teams, resulting in the departure of up to one-fifth of staff on some chip design teams."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. These internal challenges highlight the difficulty of custom chip development, reinforcing NVIDIA's strong position as a reliable, high-performance supplier. The involvement of OpenAI in design revisions suggests the complexity and evolving demands of leading AI models.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The specific internal struggles and staffing issues are likely less widely known than the general delay, offering a more nuanced understanding of the situation.

*   **Snippet:** "Moreover, Amazon's Trainium2 custom AI chip offers 30-40% better price performance than competing GPUs and makes it highly cost-effective for AI training and inference. This chip has become the backbone for Anthropic's Claude models and Amazon's Bedrock platform with Claude 4 as its fastest-growing model ever."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While a long-term competitive threat, the immediate impact on NVIDIA's upcoming earnings may be limited as hyperscalers often use a mix of custom and third-party chips. This highlights Amazon's strong internal capabilities and cost-optimization efforts.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Amazon's commitment to custom silicon is known, but the specific "30-40% better price performance" claim is a strong competitive statement that the market may not fully discount against NVIDIA's ecosystem advantages.

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This indicates Amazon's aggressive long-term strategy in custom AI silicon, which will continue to be a competitive factor for NVIDIA. However, the "late this year" release means it won't impact Q2 FY2026 earnings directly.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Amazon's continuous innovation in custom chips is generally known, but the specific timeline for Trainium 3's release provides a concrete data point for future competitive analysis.

*   **Snippet:** "Google, meanwhile, has seen success with its custom AI chips - called Tensor Processing Units - and in April unveiled its seventh-generation AI chip designed to speed the performance of AI applications."

    *   **Impact:** Low-Medium. While Google is advancing its TPUs, the lack of specific, recent details on a new cloud TPU (v6) within the last three months, beyond this general reference to a "seventh-generation" chip, suggests less immediate competitive pressure on NVIDIA compared to what might be assumed.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The market generally expects continuous innovation from Google in custom silicon. The absence of detailed, recent updates on a specific new cloud TPU generation (like v6) could be overlooked, making this a subtle non-consensus point.
