## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the objective was to find and extract material, non-consensus information likely to impact the company's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. While direct port/airport customs logs with specific HS codes and monthly volumes for NVIDIA accelerators were not publicly available through general web searches, several highly relevant and material data points were identified from recent NVIDIA financial disclosures and analyst reports.

The primary challenge in fulfilling the original query was the proprietary nature of detailed customs data, which is typically behind paywalls of specialized trade intelligence platforms. However, the search successfully uncovered information that directly reflects the impact of trade policies and supply chain dynamics on NVIDIA's financial outlook.

### Human-Readable Analysis

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report will be significantly influenced by previously disclosed export control limitations and the market's evolving expectations for its next-generation Blackwell platform. The company has already factored in an approximate **$8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue** for Q2 FY2026 due to recent export control restrictions on sales to China. This is a substantial, quantifiable impact that directly affects the top line and highlights the geopolitical risks in NVIDIA's key markets.

Furthermore, while the Data Center segment remains a strong growth driver, there has been a **moderation in Q2 expected revenue** for this segment since February 2024, with current Visible Alpha consensus estimates ranging from $39.7 billion to $47.5 billion. This suggests a more cautious outlook compared to earlier projections.

A key area of non-consensus and potential volatility lies in the **outlook for NVIDIA's new Blackwell solution**. Analyst forecasts for Blackwell revenue in Q2 FY2026 show a wide dispersion, ranging from $7.3 billion to $34.0 billion, with a consensus around $20.4 billion. This wide range indicates significant uncertainty among analysts regarding the timing of Blackwell's ramp-up and its total addressable market (TAM), making any deviation from the consensus a potential market mover.

Finally, the **consensus gross profit margin for the Data Center segment for FY 2026 is projected to decrease** by over 100 basis points to 74.1% from the 75.2% estimated last quarter. This anticipated decline is attributed, in part, to higher costs associated with the Blackwell ramp, suggesting potential pressure on profitability despite strong demand.

These factors collectively represent material information that could lead to significant market reactions depending on how NVIDIA's actual Q2 results and forward guidance align with or deviate from these expectations. The H20 revenue loss is a known headwind, but the magnitude of Blackwell's contribution and the associated margin impacts are areas where non-consensus views could lead to surprises.

### Structured Findings

**1. Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026, NVIDIA Newsroom (investor.nvidia.com)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, quantifiable impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 revenue guidance due to geopolitical factors. A loss of $8.0 billion is significant and will directly affect the top line.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, as it was part of NVIDIA's official Q1 FY2026 earnings announcement and Q2 guidance. However, the specific magnitude of the impact might be overlooked in broader market narratives.

**2. Snippet:** "Total revenue of $46.4 billion is expected for Fiscal Q2 2026, according to Visible Alpha consensus. Revenue growth is driven by optimism about Nvidia's Data Center segment, Q2 expected top line performance of which increased by almost 50% to $41.3 billion since January 2024. Since the February quarter, however, expected revenue for Q2 has moderated and based on Visible Alpha consensus, Data Center revenue estimates in Q2 2026 range from $39.7 billion to $47.5 billion."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While a consensus estimate, the *moderation* in expected Data Center revenue since February 2024 suggests a shift in analyst sentiment that could be non-consensus for some investors. The range also highlights uncertainty.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is a consensus view, but the *trend* of moderation since earlier in the year could be a non-consensus insight for those not closely tracking estimate revisions.

**3. Snippet:** "There are questions around the outlook for Nvidia's new solution, Blackwell, which claims to significantly reduce energy consumption and cost for customers, including concerns about the timing of Blackwell's growth and its total addressable market (TAM). This is reflected in the revenue estimates for the new B-series. Forecasts from 11 sources range from $7.3 billion to $34.0 billion in Q2, with consensus at $20.4 billion. This has triggered debate about the Data Center segment's future performance."

*   **Impact:** High. The extremely wide range of Blackwell revenue forecasts ($7.3B to $34.0B) indicates significant non-consensus views and high uncertainty. Any reported Blackwell performance significantly outside the $20.4 billion consensus could be a major catalyst.
*   **Consensus Check:** The existence of a wide range and "debate" explicitly points to a non-consensus situation regarding Blackwell's near-term impact.

**4. Snippet:** "Visible Alpha consensus for the gross profit of this segment in Q2 26 has remained between $30.0 billion and $31.0 billion, due to the higher costs associated with the Blackwell ramp. The consensus gross profit margin for the Data Center segment for FY 2026 continued to decrease, falling over 100bps to 74.1% from the 75.2% estimated at the end of last quarter."

*   **Impact:** Medium. A projected decrease of over 100 basis points in the Data Center gross profit margin for FY 2026, partly due to Blackwell ramp costs, indicates potential pressure on profitability. This could be overlooked if the focus is solely on revenue growth.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is a consensus projection, but the specific *reasoning* (Blackwell ramp costs) and the *magnitude* of the decline in margin could be a non-consensus detail for some investors.
