## Analysis

The search conducted for "Quantum computing threats to NVIDIA GPUs discussions impact on long-term Data Center guidance site:reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing" within the last three months did not yield any direct discussions from the specified subreddit (`reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing`) that explicitly detail "quantum computing threats to NVIDIA GPUs" and their "impact on long-term Data Center guidance."

The search results primarily focused on:
*   NVIDIA's own strategic positioning and investments in quantum computing.
*   General long-term technological shifts where quantum computing *could* eventually disrupt the current GPU-centric paradigm, but without specific discussions or quantification of threats to NVIDIA's current GPU business or Data Center guidance.
*   Comparisons of quantum computing companies like IonQ to NVIDIA's past growth, highlighting the potential of quantum technology rather than a direct threat to NVIDIA's existing GPU market.
*   NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's evolving views on the timeline for practical quantum computing.

Therefore, based on the precise query and source filter, no material, non-consensus information regarding quantum computing *threats* to NVIDIA GPUs impacting long-term Data Center guidance was found on `reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing` within the specified timeframe.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

While the broader market is certainly discussing the long-term implications of quantum computing, and NVIDIA itself is actively engaging with the quantum space, the specific discussions on Reddit's r/QuantumComputing subreddit regarding direct threats to NVIDIA's GPU business or its Data Center guidance from quantum computing were not identified in the recent search. This suggests that either such discussions are not prominent on that specific forum, or they do not explicitly frame quantum computing as an immediate or near-term "threat" in a way that would materially impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings or forward-looking guidance for Q2 FY2026. The existing information points more towards NVIDIA's proactive stance in embracing quantum technologies rather than a defensive posture against an imminent threat.

**Structured Findings:**

Given the strict filter for `site:reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing` and the specific nature of the "threats" query, no direct snippets matching the criteria were found. The provided search results, while mentioning quantum computing and NVIDIA, did not originate from the specified subreddit or discuss direct threats to NVIDIA GPUs from quantum computing impacting Data Center guidance.
