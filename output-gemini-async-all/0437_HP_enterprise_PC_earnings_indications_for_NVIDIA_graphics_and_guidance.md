## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the most critical immediate context is that **HP Inc. (HPQ) is scheduled to release its Q3 FY2025 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025, the same day NVIDIA reports its Q2 FY2026 results.** This means the actual, detailed commentary from HP's earnings call regarding PC and workstation GPU demand will not be available before NVIDIA's report.

However, pre-earnings analyst reports and industry commentary published within the last three months offer significant insights into HP's performance, particularly in areas relevant to NVIDIA's graphics and guidance. The overarching theme is the strong momentum in the "AI PC" category and gaming, which are expected to drive HP's Personal Systems segment.

Here are the key findings, extracted from recent web content:

### Structured Findings:

*   **Snippet:** "HP's overall third-quarter fiscal 2025 performance is likely to have been driven by continued momentum across the Personal Systems, slightly offset by softness in the Printing division. Strength in the AI PC category, driven by recent product launches, Windows 11 refresh cycles and increased adoption of AI PC, is likely to have boosted the top-line growth and result in sequential margin improvement for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Personal Systems segment's third-quarter sales is pegged at $9.99 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.7%."

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report for Q2 FY2026 (ending July 2025) will be influenced by several factors, and indications from HP Inc.'s (HPQ) performance, particularly in its Personal Systems segment, offer valuable insights. While HP's Q3 FY2025 earnings are also due today after market close, pre-earnings commentary and analyst expectations provide a strong directional signal.

The most material information points to a robust performance in HP's Personal Systems, with a projected year-over-year growth of 6.7% in Q3 FY2025 sales, reaching an estimated $9.99 billion. This growth is primarily attributed to the burgeoning "AI PC" category, driven by new product launches and the Windows 11 refresh cycle. HP's specific AI PC offerings, such as the OmniBook Ultra Flip and EliteBook X, are highlighted for their integration of neural processing units (NPUs), which are crucial for localized AI capabilities. This directly benefits NVIDIA, a leading provider of GPUs with advanced AI processing power, including those with integrated NPUs or discrete GPUs that complement NPU-equipped CPUs.

Furthermore, HP's own marketing materials explicitly showcase "NVIDIA Power for You" in their workstations, emphasizing NVIDIA RTX GPUs for demanding tasks like AI, graphics, and data processing. This confirms a deep and ongoing partnership, indicating that HP's success in high-performance and AI-focused enterprise PCs translates directly into demand for NVIDIA's professional visualization and data science GPUs.

Beyond AI PCs, HP also anticipates growth from the "growing adoption of gaming experiences," with its OMEN gaming line expected to contribute positively to the top line. As a dominant supplier of gaming GPUs, NVIDIA stands to benefit from this trend.

A significant, potentially non-consensus detail is HP's strategic investment, including a $116 million acquisition, and its stated goal to boost AI PC sales to 25% by 2026. This forward-looking target underscores a sustained and aggressive push into AI-capable hardware, suggesting a long-term tailwind for NVIDIA's GPU demand in the PC market.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
The primary gap is the absence of the actual HP Q3 FY2025 earnings call transcript, which would provide the most direct and detailed commentary on GPU demand and future guidance. All current insights are based on pre-release analyst expectations and existing market information. While the "AI PC" trend is clear, the exact breakdown of how much of HP's Personal Systems revenue is directly attributable to NVIDIA GPUs versus other integrated or discrete graphics solutions is not explicitly stated in the available pre-earnings reports. However, the strong emphasis on AI and gaming, coupled with HP's explicit promotion of NVIDIA-powered workstations, strongly suggests a positive read-through for NVIDIA. It's also worth noting that HP has a history of missing EPS estimates, which could introduce some caution despite positive revenue trends in its Personal Systems segment.
