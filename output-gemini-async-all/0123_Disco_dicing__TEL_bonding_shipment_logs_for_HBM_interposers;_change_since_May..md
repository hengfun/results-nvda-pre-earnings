**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance are likely to be significantly influenced by the dynamic landscape of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply and advanced packaging. Recent developments indicate a robust, albeit complex, environment for securing the critical HBM components essential for NVIDIA's AI accelerators.

A key positive indicator comes from **DISCO Corporation**, a leading manufacturer of wafer dicing equipment. Their Q1 FY2025 (April-June 2025) non-consolidated shipments, which are closely correlated with market trends, saw an 8.5% year-on-year increase, reaching a near-record high. This surge is primarily attributed to demand for generative AI, suggesting a healthy flow of diced wafers, including those for HBM interposers, into the supply chain during the quarter NVIDIA is reporting on. This increased activity in a foundational manufacturing step bodes well for NVIDIA's ability to procure necessary components.

Looking ahead, the shift towards **hybrid bonding** in advanced packaging is gaining significant momentum. Equipment manufacturers like BESI are projecting a substantial rise in orders for hybrid bonding systems in the second half of 2025, driven by the roadmap for new advanced logic and HBM4 products. This transition is critical for enabling higher-stack HBM (16-Hi and beyond), which NVIDIA's future AI accelerators will increasingly rely on. The acceleration in hybrid bonding adoption, with Samsung reportedly researching it for 12-layer HBM4 by year-end, suggests a path to increased HBM capacity and potentially improved yields.

Crucially, NVIDIA is actively managing its HBM supply chain. Recent reports indicate that **NVIDIA is diversifying its HBM4 suppliers**, moving beyond a sole reliance on SK Hynix, which is reportedly raising its HBM4 prices. Samsung has successfully qualified its HBM4 memory samples with NVIDIA, and mass production is imminent. This strategic diversification could lead to more competitive pricing and a more resilient supply of HBM for NVIDIA, positively impacting its cost of goods sold and overall production capacity in the coming quarters.

Furthermore, investments in quality control are evident. **Nova Ltd. recently launched its WMC modular optical metrology platform**, designed for advanced packaging and already adopted by a leading HBM memory manufacturer. This focus on precise measurement and quality assurance in HBM production should contribute to higher yields and more reliable HBM modules for NVIDIA. Additionally, NVIDIA itself has reportedly implemented a policy requiring **full testing of HBM stacks by memory suppliers before shipment to foundries**, a move aimed at reducing costs associated with faulty HBM and improving overall package yields.

While these developments paint a generally positive picture for NVIDIA's HBM supply, it's important to note a potential underlying constraint. Despite booming AI demand and rising fab investments, overall silicon wafer shipments have remained relatively flat due to a significant increase in fab cycle times (up 14.8% since 2020) caused by rising process complexity. This suggests that while advanced packaging and dicing capacity are increasing, the upstream wafer supply could still present a bottleneck for the entire HBM ecosystem, potentially limiting the full upside of increased packaging efficiency.

In summary, the recent data points suggest an improving and diversifying HBM supply chain for NVIDIA, with increased activity in key manufacturing steps like dicing and a rapid acceleration in advanced packaging technologies like hybrid bonding. NVIDIA's proactive measures in supplier diversification and quality control are likely to mitigate some supply risks and potentially improve cost structures. However, the broader wafer supply dynamics bear watching as a potential limiting factor.
