## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is reporting its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025. As a pre-earnings research analyst, the focus is on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding the availability and lead times of high-speed copper and optical interconnects, which are crucial components for NVIDIA's AI and data center products. Recent reports indicate a complex supply chain environment with both strong demand and persistent challenges, particularly for advanced interconnect technologies.

**Key Findings and Analysis:**

The overall picture suggests that while demand for high-speed interconnects is exceptionally strong, driven by AI and data center expansion, there are ongoing supply chain constraints, especially for the most advanced solutions. NVIDIA's own flagship products, like the GB200 NVL72, have faced specific production challenges related to interconnectivity. However, key interconnect suppliers are actively ramping up production for next-generation 800G and 1.6T solutions, with some new product lines expected to contribute to revenue in late 2025 and into 2026. The shift towards optical interconnects for larger AI clusters is also a significant trend.

The most material non-consensus information appears to be the specific challenges NVIDIA is facing with the interconnectivity of its GB200 NVL72 product, leading to reduced shipment forecasts. While general chip shortages are widely known, the granular detail about "highly advanced interconnectivity" being a "significant challenge" for a specific, high-value NVIDIA product could be overlooked or underestimated by the broader market. The ramp-up timelines from interconnect suppliers provide a forward-looking view that could also be non-consensus, indicating when some of these bottlenecks might ease or new capacity comes online.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1:**
-   **Snippet:** "The main barrier lies in the uniqueness of the design integrating 72 GPUs into an NVLink domain. In order to achieve exascale performance, highly advanced interconnectivity within the same rack is required, which has become a significant challenge in the production process. Additionally, the manufacturing of the 'GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip' installed on the same product is susceptible to supply constraints in the semiconductor market. As a result, the initially planned shipment of 0.05 million to 0.08 million units has been significantly reduced and is expected to remain between 0.025 million to 0.035 million units."

With memory requirements per chip at all-time highs and AI workloads forecasted to grow 25-35% year-over-year (YoY) through 2027, the start of protracted shortages of these sought-after components is actively unfolding... pressure on the semiconductor supply chain is no longer confined to front-end chip fabrication. The industry now finds itself grappling with the complex constraints of packaging and integration needed to bring these high-end components to the market. Many extra wafers produced thanks to upscaled fab capacity are now in line for the advanced packaging steps required to make them usable. TSMC's CoWoS packaging, for instance, is critical for stacking HBM alongside AI processors."
