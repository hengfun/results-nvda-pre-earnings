## Analysis

**No Direct Material, Non-Consensus Information Found on ASE/Amkor NVIDIA-Related SiP/Flip-Chip Capacity Expansion Within Last 3 Months**

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), a thorough review of web content published within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025) did not yield direct, material, and non-consensus information regarding new lines or sites for NVIDIA-related SiP/flip-chip capacity and their specific start dates from ASE Technology Holding or Amkor Technology.

While several recent earnings previews and transcripts for both ASE and Amkor were identified, these primarily focused on their general financial performance, analyst sentiment, and broader market conditions. Mentions of NVIDIA within these documents were typically in the context of overall industry trends or existing partnerships, rather than specific new capacity expansions directly attributable to NVIDIA's SiP/flip-chip demands with disclosed start dates.

The absence of such specific disclosures within the public domain during this critical pre-earnings window suggests that either:
1.  Such capacity expansions, if they exist, have not been publicly announced with the level of detail requested (e.g., specific to NVIDIA, new lines/sites, and start dates).
2.  Any new capacity is part of broader, previously announced capital expenditure plans by ASE or Amkor, without specific attribution to NVIDIA in recent updates.
3.  The information is considered proprietary and not publicly disclosed by the OSAT providers or NVIDIA.

Therefore, based on the conducted research, there is no actionable, non-consensus information from ASE or Amkor regarding new NVIDIA-specific SiP/flip-chip capacity that is likely to materially impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

**Summary of Findings (Lack of Specific Information):**

No specific snippets meeting the criteria of disclosing new lines or sites for NVIDIA-related SiP/flip-chip capacity and start dates from ASE or Amkor within the last three months were found. The search results primarily contained general earnings-related discussions for both companies and NVIDIA.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
The primary gap is the complete absence of the specific information requested. There were no contradictions as no direct statements on new NVIDIA-specific SiP/flip-chip capacity from ASE or Amkor were found to begin with. The general discussions in earnings previews and transcripts did not delve into the granular details of customer-specific capacity expansions or their timelines.
