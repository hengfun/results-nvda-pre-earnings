## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into its strategic partnership with ServiceNow (NOW) reveals material, non-consensus information that could influence investor sentiment and forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The recent performance of ServiceNow, a critical enterprise software partner for NVIDIA, offers a compelling, non-consensus insight into the underlying demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure and software. ServiceNow's Q2 FY2025 earnings, reported just weeks ago, demonstrate a significant acceleration in AI-driven deal wins and revenue growth, with AI capabilities explicitly cited as a major factor in securing large enterprise contracts. The co-development of the Apriel Nemotron 15B reasoning model and the integration of NVIDIA NeMo microservices further solidify the deep technical ties and the reliance of ServiceNow's successful AI offerings on NVIDIA's ecosystem.

While NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings will undoubtedly be dominated by discussions around hyperscaler demand and the impact of China export restrictions, the robust and accelerating enterprise adoption of NVIDIA-powered AI through partners like ServiceNow represents a strong, diversified demand driver. The market might be underestimating the cumulative impact of these enterprise-level successes on NVIDIA's overall data center revenue and future guidance. The tangible financial results from ServiceNow's AI products, including a clear path to $1 billion in ACV by 2026, suggest a sustained and growing pipeline for NVIDIA's core AI technologies, providing a positive signal that could temper concerns related to other market segments.
