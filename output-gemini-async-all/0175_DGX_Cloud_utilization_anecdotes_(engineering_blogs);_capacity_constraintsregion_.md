## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a review of recent developments in its DGX Cloud offerings, capacity management, and strategic expansions reveals several material, non-consensus insights likely to influence the company's performance and forward-looking guidance. The overarching theme is one of sustained, robust demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure, met with strategic expansions and a unique operating model for its cloud services.

Key findings indicate a significant financial trajectory for DGX Cloud, with multi-year agreements reaching substantial figures. Furthermore, NVIDIA's management has explicitly stated that supply constraints are expected to persist through 2026, underpinned by massive hyperscaler investments in AI. The imminent production shipments of Blackwell Ultra instances and GB300 systems within the current quarter are also critical. Geographically, the expansion of DGX Cloud Lepton into Europe, coupled with domestic manufacturing initiatives in the US, highlights strategic efforts to broaden market reach and enhance supply chain resilience. Finally, a notable order for H20 AI chips from TSMC underscores continued strong demand from the Chinese market, despite previous export restrictions.

While general demand for NVIDIA's products is widely acknowledged, the specific financial figures for DGX Cloud, the explicit 2026 supply constraint, the precise timing of next-generation chip shipments, and the details of regional expansion and manufacturing investments offer more granular, potentially overlooked information for investors.

### Structured Findings:

**1. DGX Cloud Multi-year Cloud Service Agreements & Revenue Projections**
*   **Snippet:** "Analysts indicate that despite NVIDIA not separately disclosing the revenue and profit from DGX Cloud, the company stated it signed multi-year cloud service agreements worth 10.9 billion dollars in the latest fiscal year, up from 3.5 billion dollars the previous year, largely to support DGX Cloud. Considering that cloud computing usually has high profit margins, this represents a considerably substantial business scale. It is worth mentioning that DGX Cloud adopts a different operation model: the cloud computing giants are responsible for purchasing and managing equipment, including NVIDIA chips, which form the service infrastructure. Then, NVIDIA rents these devices back from them and subleases them to enterprise clients while providing AI expert support..." "UBS Group analysts expect its annual revenue to exceed 10 billion dollars."
*   **Date:** June 25, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA, in collaboration with emerging players, is challenging the traditional three giants by 'invading' the cloud computing field. - Moomoo, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFXRsSVDAjjkXpsEi1QenBkSRVK_LRY09_yV5y69-ehLAG3Lbd9vRtItQilxtbFtCH1V3viLMDGqUuPMzas3SNOEkfA1RfawpUAJVCX8LJDsJOYzsN8iHeAH-xYfSYGIzvilRnaWEXbuwus1wCniKcCg-LlMuj57X7kFiq0MsSQdA2-fI3jCzUZ-e-dg5s60iepQ7lwlFsuAOy3kQnI6ccmzQrBmxqZMi042HlRpZwS8Zo=
*   **Impact:** High. The reported $10.9 billion in multi-year agreements and the UBS analyst projection of over $10 billion in annual revenue for DGX Cloud provide a strong, quantifiable indicator of the platform's financial contribution and growth. This specific financial detail, combined with the unique operating model, suggests a potentially higher-margin and rapidly scaling business that may not be fully reflected in general market sentiment.
*   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While the growth of DGX Cloud is generally understood, these specific financial figures and the detailed operational structure are likely less widely known or fully priced in compared to broader data center revenue expectations.

**2. NVIDIA Supply-Constrained for All of 2026 & Hyperscaler Spending**
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia is supply-constrained for all of 2026, according to management." "The AI boom is real, with hyperscalers committed to $5.4 trillion in AI spending through 2030, ensuring Nvidia's chip utility dominance and supply constraints."
