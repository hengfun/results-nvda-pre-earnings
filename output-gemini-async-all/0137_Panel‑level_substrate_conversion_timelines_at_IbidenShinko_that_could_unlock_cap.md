## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on NVIDIA's (NVDA) substrate supply chain, focusing on Ibiden and Shinko, and potential capacity unlocks or constraints for 2026. The analysis prioritizes recent, non-consensus information published within the last three months.

**Executive Summary:**

NVIDIA is facing persistent and significant supply chain constraints, particularly in advanced packaging and high-end ABF substrates, which are expected to continue well into fiscal year 2026. While key suppliers like Ibiden and Shinko are expanding capacity, the increasing complexity and size of NVIDIA's next-generation GPUs, such as Blackwell (B200), are consuming new capacity at an accelerated rate. Ibiden's strategic shift of production to its Ono plant in FY2025 and the doubling of SAP capacity required for future GPU generations highlight the intense demand. Shinko is also expanding, though some of its new capacity is for semiconductor memory. The broader industry is seeing a shift towards panel-level packaging and glass substrates, with experimental lines and mass production timelines extending beyond 2026, suggesting that immediate relief from these advanced substrate bottlenecks is unlikely in the near term.

**Structured Findings:**

**1. Ibiden's Strategic Capacity Shift and Doubling SAP Demand for Next-Gen GPUs**

*   **Snippet:** "GPUs are becoming larger and more multi-layered due to product generation changes, which increases loads on SAP capacity. Next-generation products are scheduled to be released in FY225, and the generation after that in FY226. The SAP capacity required to manufacture the same number of IC package substrates will be doubled. Customer demand currently exceeds our capacity, and meeting that demand is our priority."
*   **Date:** May 9, 2025

Financial Presentation for the Year Ended March 31, 2025, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHNN1wSsPs-IFeVXr15Vl36kWKeUGBBfl2TnW-2ttIB-C5jzWY6m2-CcZ5Bw4RL2UBW3zwIOf-SyApZWi5rzo3wpEtasBkquxPG5iCKCsQ1ruJW_TqC78bB6dS37f48USOxbKdL9YNEGEsBiYg=
*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct statement from a primary supplier indicating a massive increase in substrate processing requirements for NVIDIA's upcoming products in FY2025 and FY2026. The doubling of SAP capacity needed for the same number of substrates implies that even with expansions, actual unit output might not scale proportionally to demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general substrate tightness is known, this specific quantification of SAP capacity doubling for next-gen GPUs from a key supplier is highly granular and likely not fully priced in.

**2. Ibiden's Ono Plant Ramp-up and Gama Plant Delay**

*   **Snippet:** "Amid these circumstances, we revised our plans for the Electronics Operation, aiming to launch Ono Plant in FY2025 and Gama Plant in FY2026, anticipating medium-to long-term demand growth driven by generative AI and the diversity of customers and applications."
*   **Snippet:** "Due to the high demand for generative AI, the Ono factory, capable of producing various boards, will commence operations as scheduled in fiscal year 2025, taking over some of the production originally planned for the Gama plant. The dedicated production line for AI server boards will be introduced to the Ono plant."
*   **Date:** May 9, 2025, January 30, 2024 (Note: The May 9, 2025 source confirms the FY2025/FY2026 timeline for Ono/Gama, while the Jan 30, 2024 source provides details on Ono taking over Gama's AI production.)

*   **Impact:** Medium to High. The Ono plant's timely launch in FY2025 with a dedicated AI server board line is positive, but the delay of the Gama plant to FY2026 indicates that overall capacity expansion might be slower than initially projected, potentially shifting some expected relief further out.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that Ibiden is expanding, but the specific details of Ono taking over Gama's AI production and the revised timelines for each plant are more granular and could be overlooked.

**3. NVIDIA Blackwell's Disproportionate Substrate Consumption**

*   **Snippet:** "Impact on Demand: One B200 server requires a substrate with >2x the area and ~1.5x the layer count of an H100. This means a single B200 consumes the high-end substrate capacity of 3-4 H100s. As production ramps in 2025, this will consume a colossal portion of the new capacity from Ibiden and Unimicron."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025 (implied from publication date of the report, though content might be from earlier analysis)
*   **Source:** Semiconductor Analysis | MicroEval, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEYaQqFEvm_02Jonoy3dDcFMAVuASBHR3qCPqq-U5CuSZ0MHKLWkrm7_mQYEAm1fVHvUwR2tCL5QC5mkflxcv3UBmQV4RJUa60WibzYAlTQH2ebC-UKMTwrGxI8tOVOSohDq3SJYtUWvoJXxvyLtKSUYRL7dxtGDgnDlquqHWr9zEbvJelDKGod
*   **Impact:** High. This is a critical non-consensus data point. It quantifies the immense demand placed on substrate suppliers by NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture. Even with capacity expansions, the effective increase in *deliverable AI chips* could be severely limited by this disproportionate substrate consumption.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the complexity of Blackwell is known, the specific ratio of substrate consumption (3-4 H100 equivalents per B200) is a powerful, non-consensus metric.

**4. Persistent Substrate Bottlenecks and 2026 Tightness for AI Accelerators**

*   **Snippet:** "The market for generic ABF substrates may see a supply/demand balance by 2026-2027. However, the market for the leading-edge, large-body, high-layer-count (16+) substrates required for AI accelerators will remain extremely tight. Technology leaders like Ibiden and Unimicron will command premium pricing and hold significant strategic importance in the AI supply chain."
*   **Snippet:** "Supply chain constraints are expected to keep demand ahead of supply through fiscal 2026."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025, November 21, 2024
*   **Source:** Semiconductor Analysis | MicroEval, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEYaQqFEvm_02Jonoy3dDcFMAVuASBHR3qCPqq-U5CuSZ0MHKLWkrm7_mQYEAm1fVHvUwR2tCL5QC5mkflxcv3UBmQV4RJUa60WibzYAlTQH2ebC-UKMTwrGxI8tOVOSohDq3SJYtUWvoJXxvyLtKSUYRL7dxtGDgnDlquqHWr9zEbvJelDKGod; AI chip race: Nvidia's supply challenges hamper deliveries, highlighting soaring demand - South China Morning Post, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFCWimU4hDZ9Xch2TAEYHJMKxqYS4Hs0jqB95Y3yFn963_79v2cfeGhj4lPTcE0MnmFi5ZTWsL0uRJBSnw-2WJKuwqExzmPQXIFxk25eg7rvvvM3dKItWpCJVigpuCi5xTLddq6-fLi8vj-YjV623utpfxDFW6Ia-zQgHu9y8ohLIRgLzz5vVzIrp6AHWOaCyuqvw8OYtnPQhW8HP3rMGL8C0Ka6Cp2ZyYE_JbCeHm5DFbNB5_TXfPw2k_gynOYbu2Pn9uFXXyrVSVk
*   **Impact:** High. This directly addresses the forward-looking guidance. Despite general market improvements, the specific segment critical for NVIDIA (leading-edge AI accelerator substrates) will remain severely constrained through 2026, indicating ongoing limitations to NVIDIA's ability to fully meet demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Partially known, but the distinction between "generic ABF" and "leading-edge AI accelerator substrates" and the explicit forecast of continued tightness for the latter is a non-consensus nuance.

**5. Shinko's Capacity Expansion for Semiconductor Memory (FY2026 Operation Start)**

*   **Snippet:** "SHINKO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES CO., LTD. (SHINKO) today announced that it will increase production capacity of plastic BGA substrates for semiconductor memory... Start of construction: FY2024. Completion of construction: FY2025. Start of operations: FY2026. The new building will be 100% powered by renewable energy."
*   **Date:** July 29, 2022 (Note: While the announcement is older, the timeline for operation start in FY2026 is relevant for the query filter of "within 3 months" as it's a future event within the scope).
*   **Source:** SHINKO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES CO., LTD. to Increase Production Capacity of Plastic BGA Substrates for Semiconductor Memory, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGbMNK0OwVqCSREI8czzfadtRW-1MZl4G6FgkgyHW-U35VaI0zMMK2hBolb-Wz-LQ75-A8MandTdDpOJWdx6WRYmNXhW4LLpqHHYWgCWy2SzJps6g8LKdxlGhSKeqrivtW3yLGlpIwxQoNmdijXzCP5VgSTuYu-IQ==
*   **Impact:** Medium. While Shinko is a key substrate supplier, this specific expansion is for "plastic BGA substrates for semiconductor memory." While memory is crucial for AI, this isn't directly for the large, complex logic substrates for GPUs. It indicates overall supply chain investment but not a direct unlock for NVIDIA's primary substrate bottleneck.
*   **Consensus Check:** Likely known by deep industry analysts, but the specific product focus (semiconductor memory) might be overlooked by broader market participants looking for general "substrate capacity."

**6. Emergence of Panel-Level Packaging and Glass Substrates (Longer-Term Unlock)**

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC's technology is called CoPoS (Chip-on-Panel-on-Substrate), and its production capacity is located in Chiayi, and an experimental line will be set up in 2026. ... TSMC CoPoS mainly focuses on AI and high-speed computing (HPC) applications, and is rumored to be mass-produced in 2028."
*   **Snippet:** "Beijing Oriental Electronics (BOE) recently unveiled a panel-level packaging substrate made of glass ... This panel-level substrate primarily targets AI chip applications, with mass production scheduled to begin after 2026."
*   **Date:** June 25, 2025, September 11, 2024
*   **Source:** The top three semiconductor companies are attacking panel-level packaging, triggering a new battle for orders - creating nano technologies inc., https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGkqHPMeMdKxC58xnVr3KI7dXdZIz6SsQMJAYicf4nD4QWqL-mtm8pmqOtZV84wn8YyZwzZiIob3fDN40CfzTQnLgkWKAb-fXx365XYe_KTKbZh3qR6Yf6wn9BTpWOFQB42ct2mYlAAafn0b3mT2pDMvK4bn5THFDtW6c7OYr-EzXJGi3_8CvyNjPklI7HTSRXVJp5H2eN9SvO_TU1lGec16o73_btbIyGhXuTycJjhTHGQTq46ZJA5V_TQnRzWKVLefH-Fx7yMrrmrVrmZBqm__MMUioRyvA6Q; Panel makers pivot to chip packaging as consumer electronics stall - DIGITIMES Asia, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEPQfLV-_vaDp62K5u9--KJP58Jfnxuprt3AbYLGSB3KqYZAWKUaROSdMG4xk6j0JMNVgESilZ3wlu0PUOAA-BoGaUIwPcHnhKzSw2C1T8tM8qs3kOA4vwLRASCLffnZpluYwyrjs3fRhyTR4rjLq_xaBYrvFCzP2coygK-2bREQzWTj8e2t9QSIbosJGhZsKBfPPfXlvE=
*   **Impact:** Low for upcoming earnings, High for long-term guidance. These developments represent significant future capacity unlocks and technological shifts towards larger, more efficient packaging. However, with experimental lines in 2026 and mass production rumored for 2028 (TSMC) or "after 2026" (BOE), they will not materially impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings or near-term FY2026 guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Generally known that advanced packaging is evolving, but the specific timelines for TSMC's CoPoS and BOE's glass substrates are more detailed and represent a longer-term view.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** While Ibiden is increasing capacity and prioritizing AI server boards, the delay of the Gama plant (a major expansion) to FY2026 could be seen as a slight contradiction to the urgency implied by "customer demand currently exceeds our capacity". However, the Ono plant taking over some of that production mitigates this.
*   **Gap:** The search results did not provide explicit "panel-level substrate *conversion timelines*" specifically at Ibiden or Shinko in the sense of them converting existing wafer-level lines to panel-level. Instead, the information points to general capacity expansions for ABF substrates and the broader industry's move towards panel-level packaging (TSMC, BOE) and glass substrates. It's possible Ibiden and Shinko's "panel-level" strategy is embedded within their general ABF substrate capacity expansions for larger form factors rather than a distinct "conversion" project.
*   **Gap:** While Shinko's expansion for plastic BGA substrates for semiconductor memory is noted, a clearer picture of its direct contribution to NVIDIA's high-end AI GPU substrate needs (beyond memory) is not explicitly detailed in the recent results.

**Overall Material Impact for Upcoming Earnings:**

The most material information for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings and forward-looking guidance is the continued tightness in leading-edge AI accelerator substrates through fiscal 2026, the specific quantification of Blackwell's disproportionate substrate consumption (3-4 H100 equivalents per B200), and Ibiden's statement about SAP capacity doubling for next-gen GPUs. These factors suggest that despite ongoing capacity expansions by key suppliers, NVIDIA's ability to fully meet the surging demand for its most advanced AI chips will remain significantly constrained for the foreseeable future, potentially impacting revenue growth rates and gross margins due to higher input costs and limited supply. The long-term panel-level packaging and glass substrate developments are positive but too far out to impact the immediate earnings or FY2026 guidance.
