## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a review of recent market intelligence reveals several non-consensus data points and trends that could materially impact the company's performance and forward-looking guidance, particularly concerning the risk of Average Selling Price (ASP) declines for its server GPUs and the broader market dynamics. While direct information on "leasing residual values in lessor filings" remains elusive in public reports, the observed trends in GPU pricing, availability, and demand directly influence the underlying value and depreciation of these assets.

Key findings indicate a softening in GPU pricing, increased supply, and some early signs of potential demand moderation from hyperscalers, alongside the ongoing impact of U.S.-China trade policies on margins. These factors, if not fully accounted for in consensus estimates, could lead to surprises in NVIDIA's data center revenue and profitability.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "The H100 seems to be following a similar path, with prices falling by around 20% over the past year. Lead times, which used to be up to 6 months, have now reduced to just a few weeks or even less."
- **Date:** September 3, 2024 (Note: This article, while published in late 2024, discusses trends "over the past year" leading up to its publication and "now reduced" lead times, making the information on price and lead time relevant to the current period leading into Q2 FY2026.)
- **Source:** The Missing Guide to the H100 GPU Market | by Lepton AI | Medium, [URL if available]
- **Impact:** High. This indicates a significant and ongoing trend of ASP erosion for NVIDIA's flagship H100 GPUs, driven by improved supply. Reduced lead times suggest that the scarcity premium that previously bolstered prices is diminishing. This could directly impact data center revenue growth and gross margins if not fully priced into analyst models.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While some analysts acknowledge increasing supply, a 20% price decline over the past year for H100s might be more aggressive than widely assumed, especially when considering the rapid reduction in lead times.

- **Snippet:** "Cloud pricing for H100 GPUs has seen significant decreases throughout 2025, with rates dropping from historical highs of $8 per hour to a more competitive range of $2.85-$3.50."
- **Date:** April 12, 2025
- **Source:** NVIDIA H100 Price Guide 2025: Detailed Costs, Comparisons & Expert Insights, [URL if available]
- **Impact:** High. Cloud rental rates are a direct proxy for the market value and demand elasticity of NVIDIA's GPUs. A substantial drop from $8/hour to $2.85-$3.50/hour within 2025 signifies considerable pricing pressure in a key consumption model for AI compute. This could indicate a broader trend of ASP declines for direct sales as well.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While cloud pricing is tracked, the magnitude and speed of this decline throughout 2025 might not be fully appreciated by all analysts, especially those focused solely on direct sales.

- **Snippet:** "Losses in Asian markets came tracking a nearly 6% overnight decline in Nvidia, after TD Cowen said in a note that major AI investor Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was cancelling data center leases in the U.S. and Europe. The company had walked away from over two gigawatts of capacity in both the U.S. and Europe in the past six months, and had also canceled existing leases in the past month."
- **Date:** March 27, 2025
- **Source:** Nvidia's Asian suppliers sink on data center oversupply doubts By Investing.com, [URL if available]
- **Impact:** High. Microsoft is a major hyperscaler and a significant customer for NVIDIA's data center GPUs. Cancellations of data center leases, even if partially backfilled by other hyperscalers, signal a potential oversupply or a re-evaluation of AI infrastructure needs by a key player. This could lead to softer demand for NVIDIA's chips than currently anticipated by the market.
- **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. While the market generally expects strong AI server demand, a specific report of a major hyperscaler like Microsoft cancelling leases due to potential oversupply is a strong, non-consensus signal that could temper bullish demand forecasts.

- **Snippet:** "Nvidia negotiated a trade deal that allowed them to sell their downgraded H20 chips to China, but here's the catch: they have to hand over 15% of all related revenue directly to the U.S. Treasury. Not profit, but revenue. That's coming right off the top line before any costs are accounted for."
- **Date:** August 20, 2025
- **Source:** Nvidia Is About To Beat Estimates, But It Might Not Be Enough (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha, [URL if available]
- **Impact:** Medium. While the resumption of H20 sales to China is positive for revenue, the 15% revenue share directly impacts NVIDIA's top line and gross margins. This is a direct and quantifiable headwind to profitability from a significant market. NVIDIA's Q1 FY26 gross margins were already impacted by H20-related charges.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known but potentially underestimated impact. The fact of the revenue sharing agreement is known, but the full implications of a 15% *revenue* cut (not profit) on overall gross margins, especially when combined with other pricing pressures, might be underestimated by some.

- **Snippet:** "As newer GPUs are introduced, older models typically see a decline in price. However, enterprise GPUs like the H100 don't depreciate as quickly as consumer GPUs because: ... Used H100 GPUs (from retired servers) sell for 20-40% less, making them attractive for businesses seeking cost-effective AI acceleration."
- **Date:** (No specific date, but context is current market trends)
- **Source:** How Does the Price of the NVIDIA H100 Change Over Time? - Cyfuture Cloud, [URL if available]
- **Impact:** Medium. This snippet, while not directly about residual values in lessor filings, provides a strong indication of the secondary market value and depreciation of enterprise GPUs like the H100. A 20-40% discount for used H100s suggests a significant depreciation curve, which would be a key factor for lessors in determining residual values. This implicitly supports the risk of ASP declines for new units as well, as the secondary market provides a cheaper alternative.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The existence and pricing of a robust secondary market for enterprise GPUs, and its implications for new unit ASPs and lessor residual values, might not be a primary focus for all analysts.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction in China Impact:** While some sources highlight the 15% revenue cut for H20 chips in China as a margin pressure, others suggest NVIDIA's "massive pricing power" will allow them to pass this cost on to Chinese customers, thus not pressuring margins. This presents a clear point of divergence in analyst expectations regarding the net impact on profitability.
*   **Lack of Direct Lessor Filings:** Despite targeted searches, no direct information on "leasing residual values for NVDA servers in lessor filings" was found. This specific data point is likely proprietary to leasing companies and not publicly disclosed in general news or analyst reports. The extracted information on ASP declines and secondary market pricing serves as the closest proxy for understanding the underlying value trends that would influence residual values.
*   **Overall Demand vs. Specific Weakness:** While there are reports of strong overall AI server demand and increased capex from hyperscalers, the specific instance of Microsoft cancelling data center leases introduces a non-consensus element of potential demand softening or reallocation that warrants closer scrutiny. This could indicate a more nuanced demand environment than a uniformly strong one.
