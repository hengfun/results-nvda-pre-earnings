## Analysis

NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report is expected to shed further light on the adoption and financial impact of its latest technologies, particularly the NVLink-C2C interconnect. Recent developments indicate a growing, albeit controlled, integration of NVLink-C2C into OEM systems and a strategic effort by NVIDIA to maintain ecosystem dominance through its NVLink Fusion program. However, emerging competition from open standards like UALink and persistent supply chain challenges could present headwinds.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's NVLink-C2C technology, a high-bandwidth interconnect linking Grace CPUs and Blackwell GPUs, is proving to be a cornerstone of its next-generation AI infrastructure, including the GB200 and GB300 Superchips. This tight integration is enabling a shift towards GPU-centric architectures in data centers, with a notable increase in the GPU-to-CPU ratio within rack-scale systems.

OEMs are actively incorporating NVLink-C2C into their offerings. QCT, for instance, announced the first shipment of its NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system in May 2025, signaling tangible market adoption. Similarly, ASUS has launched a compact AI supercomputer, the Ascent GX10, featuring the Grace Blackwell Superchip with NVLink-C2C, and ZT Systems is integrating these components into liquid-cooled servers. This indicates a broadening reach beyond NVIDIA's direct DGX offerings.

NVIDIA's NVLink Fusion program is designed to allow partners to integrate their custom chips with NVIDIA GPUs via NVLink-C2C, expanding the ecosystem. MediaTek is a key partner, co-developing the Grace-Blackwell GB10 superchip. However, NVIDIA maintains strict control over the critical software and licensing for NVLink Switch chips, which has reportedly led to "frustration" among some partners due to limited visibility and suboptimal designs. This proprietary approach, while ensuring performance and control, could push some partners towards open alternatives.

Indeed, a coalition of tech giants including AMD, Google, and Intel has launched the UALink Consortium, an open-standard alternative to NVLink, with its 1.0 specification released in April 2025. While NVLink currently offers superior raw bandwidth, UALink's focus on flexibility and cost efficiency could pose a long-term competitive threat, particularly for hyperscalers seeking multi-vendor solutions.

From a financial perspective, the advanced integration and proprietary nature of NVLink-C2C contribute significantly to the high Average Selling Prices (ASPs) of NVIDIA's integrated solutions. The "masked networking costs" embedded within DGX, HGX, and MGX systems, including NVLink fabrics and C2C interconnects, are a key component of the overall cost of NVIDIA's GPU accelerators. This pricing strategy, while lucrative, could be challenged by more cost-effective open alternatives in the future.

Finally, while OEM adoption is progressing, the broader supply chain for NVIDIA's new AI hardware, including NVLink-C2C-enabled systems, continues to face challenges, with lead times potentially extending into 2026. This could temper revenue growth in the near term, even with strong demand.

    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While NVIDIA's new products are known, specific OEM shipment dates and customer deployments are less frequently highlighted in mainstream financial news, making this a more granular, non-consensus detail.

*   **Snippet:** "To expand its growing influence in the data center market, NVIDIA recently launched the NVLink Fusion program. This initiative enables select partners to integrate their custom-designed chips into the NVIDIA system framework. For example, a partner can connect its custom CPU to an NVIDIA GPU using the 900 GB/s NVLink-C2C interface. However, this collaboration comes with significant restrictions. Any custom chip must be connected to an NVIDIA product, and the company maintains firm control over the critical software that manages these connections. This means partners cannot create truly independent, mix-and-match systems. NVIDIA retains control over the essential communication controller and PHY layers in the NVLink Fusion, which initializes and manages these links. It also mandates a license for third-party hardware to use its NVLink Switch chips. [...] According to reports, eight companies expressed interest in NVLink Fusion. However, the frustration of working with a communication link with limited visibility results in designs that are not always optimal and efficient."
