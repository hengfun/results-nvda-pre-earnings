## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, I have identified several material, non-consensus data points regarding NVIDIA's (NVDA) H20 chip and Huawei's Ascend 910C in the Chinese spot market, with a focus on information published within the last three months. These findings suggest a highly dynamic and challenging environment for NVIDIA in China, marked by significant pricing pressure, contradictory policy signals, and intensifying domestic competition.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's position in the crucial Chinese AI chip market appears to be in flux, with recent developments presenting a mixed and often contradictory picture. While the U.S. government reportedly cleared H20 chip sales to China in July 2025, leading to a temporary surge in investor optimism and expectations of backlogged orders, very recent reports from late August 2025 suggest a renewed and significant hurdle. Specifically, there are indications that NVIDIA has instructed suppliers to halt H20 production, and, critically, Beijing has reportedly advised domestic firms to limit H20 purchases due to security concerns. This direct contradiction is a major non-consensus point that could severely impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 guidance and future revenue streams from China.

Adding to the pressure, NVIDIA's H20 chips are reportedly trading at significant discounts, exceeding 10% compared to Huawei's Ascend 910B, with some reports indicating a price range of $6,500-$8,000 for H20, a substantial reduction from previous figures. This aggressive pricing reflects the intense competition and NVIDIA's struggle to maintain market share, which has reportedly halved in China following recent export restrictions.

On the Huawei front, while the company is aggressively ramping up its Ascend 910 series production, aiming to ship over 700,000 units in 2025, its manufacturing capabilities remain a bottleneck. The Ascend 910C, despite showing promising performance (60% of H100's inference power), is hampered by low yield rates from SMIC (estimated at 30%). Furthermore, reports of Chinese AI developers like DeepSeek delaying new models due to issues with Huawei-made chips highlight the ongoing challenges in performance consistency and ecosystem maturity. China's broader strategy to triple domestic AI chip output by 2026 and reduce reliance on NVIDIA underscores a long-term shift towards self-sufficiency, with Huawei at the forefront.

The confluence of these factors – the uncertain status of H20 production and sales, aggressive pricing, and the persistent, albeit challenged, rise of Huawei – paints a picture of a highly volatile Chinese market that could present significant headwinds for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and forward-looking guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

**Finding 1: NVIDIA H20 Production Halt and Beijing's Advisory**
*   **Snippet:** "Reports suggest the company has instructed some suppliers to halt production of its China-specific H20 chips, and Beijing has advised domestic firms to limit purchases due to security concerns."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** IndexBox, (URL not provided in snippet, but context suggests a market intelligence platform)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a critical, non-consensus development. It directly contradicts the positive news from July 2025 regarding the clearance of H20 exports. A production halt and government advisory against H20 use would severely impact NVIDIA's ability to sell in China, potentially leading to further inventory charges, reduced revenue, and a significantly weaker outlook for the region.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the July clearance was widely reported and likely factored into some analyst models, these very recent reports of a production halt and Beijing's advisory are likely not fully priced in and represent a significant negative surprise.

**Finding 2: Aggressive H20 Pricing and Market Share Erosion**
*   **Snippet:** "Reports indicate H20 chips have traded at discounts exceeding 10% compared to Huawei's Ascend 910B, highlighting Nvidia's struggle to maintain pricing power against domestic alternatives. CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the erosion, revealing that Nvidia's Chinese market share has approximately halved following recent export restrictions."
*   **Date:** August 15, 2025
*   **Source:** AI News, (URL not provided in snippet, but context suggests an AI-focused publication)
*   **Impact:** High. Significant pricing pressure and a halving of market share directly impact revenue and profitability. The need for deep discounts on H20 suggests a challenging sales environment even when the chips are available, which will compress margins.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the extent of the discount (>10% vs 910B) and the explicit "halved market share" might be more specific than general consensus. The $6,500-$8,000 price range for H20 (from the same source) is also notably lower than previously reported figures, indicating deeper price cuts.

**Finding 3: Huawei Ascend 910C Production Challenges and Performance Gaps**
*   **Snippet:** "Mizuho – a Japanese financial institution and one of Japan's three “mega banks” predicts that Huawei can ship nearly 700K+ Ascend 910 series AI chips in 2025. One of the Mizuho analysts, Vijay Rakesh, says that despite SMIC's low yield on the 7nm process, Huawei will sell a large number of Ascend 910C AI chips in China. “In China, we estimate Ascend 910A/B/C potentially at 700K+ units in 2025E, but yields at key foundry SMIC remain fairly low, we estimate – 30%.” ... The DeepSeek team reportedly said 910C achieved 60% of H100's inference performance."
*   **Date:** May 17, 2025
*   **Source:** HROne, (URL not provided in snippet, but context suggests a business/HR publication citing Mizuho)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While Huawei's aggressive shipment targets indicate a strong domestic push, the low 30% yield rate from SMIC for the 910C suggests significant manufacturing inefficiencies and potential for supply constraints. The 60% inference performance compared to H100, while decent, still indicates a performance gap, and reports of DeepSeek delaying models due to Huawei chip issues further highlight these challenges. This implies Huawei is not yet a seamless replacement for NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Huawei's rise is generally known, the specific yield rate (30%) and the impact on customers like DeepSeek (delaying models) provide a more granular, non-consensus view of the practical limitations Huawei faces in scaling and performance consistency.

**Finding 4: NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 H20 Revenue Loss and Q2 Outlook Impact**
*   **Snippet:** "On April 9, 2025, NVIDIA was informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. ... NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** NVIDIA (Official Press Release)
*   **Impact:** High. This is direct company disclosure of a significant financial hit due to H20 export restrictions in Q1 and a projected $8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue for Q2. This provides a concrete financial impact that will be directly reflected in the upcoming earnings report.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This information comes directly from NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 earnings report and was likely incorporated into analyst models for Q2. However, the subsequent contradictory news about the H20 production halt (Finding 1) could exacerbate these losses or prevent any recovery.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **H20 Export Clearance vs. Production Halt:** The most glaring contradiction is the U.S. government clearing H20 sales to China in July 2025, followed by very recent reports (August 22-27, 2025) that NVIDIA instructed suppliers to halt H20 production and Beijing advised against its use due to security concerns. This creates immense uncertainty regarding NVIDIA's actual ability to generate revenue from H20 in China for Q2 FY226 and beyond.
*   **H20 Pricing Discrepancy:** The reported H20 price range of $6,500-$8,000 is significantly lower than previous figures, suggesting aggressive discounting. However, the context of this pricing (whether it's for a specific variant or a general market price) could be clearer.
*   **Huawei's True Competitive Threat:** While Huawei is making strides, the low yield rates and reported customer delays indicate that its ability to fully replace NVIDIA or meet the surging demand for high-performance AI chips in China is still constrained. The market may be underestimating these practical limitations, even as the political will for domestic alternatives is strong.
