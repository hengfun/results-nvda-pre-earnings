## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to release its Q2 FY2026 earnings report today, August 27, 2025, a recently implemented 15% US revenue sharing agreement on certain AI chip sales to China is a critical factor for investors to consider. While the agreement allows NVIDIA to resume shipments of its H20 chips to China, its financial implications for gross margins and the company's forward-looking guidance are subject to varying interpretations and potential headwinds. The agreement, which emerged in August 2025, means its direct impact on the just-ended Q2 (ending July 2025) may be limited, but it will be a significant topic for the company's Q3 FY2026 outlook.

Analysts are closely watching how NVIDIA will navigate this new landscape, especially given China's push for domestic AI chip alternatives and reported efforts to discourage the use of NVIDIA's H20 processors. The company's strategy to offset the revenue share through price increases on its upcoming China-specific Blackwell chips (B30A) and the actual demand for these products under the new conditions will be key determinants of future profitability.

Here are the key findings regarding the financial impact of the 15% US revenue sharing agreement on NVIDIA's gross margins for China sales:

---

### Structured Findings:

**1. Snippet:** "Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of revenue from sales to China of certain advanced AI chips, marking an unusual intervention in corporate activity and a potential precedent for taxing critical exports. The arrangement, which applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 processors, comes as both companies resume shipments to China after earlier export curbs. While Washington said the sales do not compromise national security, analysts warned the levy could squeeze gross margins and signal a broader move to extract payments on regulated products beyond semiconductors."
- **Date:** 2025-08-11
- **Source:** Vertex AI Search (original source likely Financial Times, as mentioned in the snippet)
- **Impact:** High. This snippet confirms the existence and core terms of the 15% revenue sharing agreement, directly addressing the research query. It highlights the direct impact on gross margins and the precedent it sets.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The existence of this agreement has been broadly reported in August 2025 across multiple financial news outlets.

**2. Snippet:** "Levy could cut Nvidia and AMD gross margins by 5–15 percentage points."
- **Date:** 2025-08-12
- **Source:** Vertex AI Search (original source likely Financial Times, as mentioned in the snippet)
- **Impact:** High. This provides a specific, albeit broad, range for the potential gross margin reduction, which is crucial for financial modeling.
- **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus/Overlooked. While the agreement is known, the specific range of potential margin impact (5-15 percentage points) might not be fully priced in or consistently modeled by all analysts, especially at the higher end.

**3. Snippet:** "This arrangement could cost Nvidia $2.7 billion annually, reducing gross margins by 8–10%, according to industry analysts."
- **Date:** 2025-08-27
- **Source:** AInvest
- **Impact:** High. This provides a more precise estimate of both the annual cost and the gross margin reduction, offering a more granular view than the broader 5-15 percentage point range.
- **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. This specific annual cost and margin reduction estimate (8-10%) from "industry analysts" is more specific than the broader range and could be a point of divergence among analysts.

**4. Snippet:** "To counter a 15% revenue-sharing mandate, NVIDIA plans to raise prices on its China-specific Blackwell chips by 18%. While this protects profits, it may slightly lower gross margins from 71% to 69.3%."
- **Date:** 2025-08-26
- **Source:** MarketPulse
- **Impact:** High. This reveals NVIDIA's proactive strategy to mitigate the impact and provides a specific, albeit slight, projected gross margin outcome after the price increase. This is a critical piece of non-consensus information regarding how NVIDIA plans to manage the situation.
- **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. NVIDIA's specific pricing strategy and its projected impact on gross margins (71% to 69.3%) is a detailed insight that might not be universally known or factored into all analyst models.

**5. Snippet:** "While gross margins suffered significantly last quarter, recovery to 71.8% is anticipated as management targets mid-70% margins despite operational headwinds. ... However, new licensing requirements for H20 chip exports to China triggered a $4.5 billion charge, causing gross margins to plunge to 60.5% from the expected 70.6%."
- **Date:** 2025-08-21, 2025-08-24
- **Source:** NVIDIA Q2 2026 earnings preview: AI growth, China chip deal, analyst forecast (IG), NVIDIA Q2 2026 earnings preview: AI growth, China chip deal, analyst forecast (IG Singapore)
- **Impact:** Medium. This provides crucial context on recent gross margin performance and the impact of initial China restrictions, setting the stage for how the new revenue-sharing agreement will affect the recovery. It highlights the volatility in margins due to China.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The $4.5 billion charge and the Q1 margin plunge were reported in NVIDIA's previous earnings, and the anticipated recovery is part of current analyst expectations.

**6. Snippet:** "And now Beijing is reportedly urging local companies to avoid using Nvidia's less-advanced H20 processors."
- **Date:** 2025-08-27
- **Source:** NDTV Profit
- **Impact:** High. This is a significant non-consensus piece of information that could severely limit the upside of the revenue-sharing agreement, even if export licenses are granted. It suggests a demand-side challenge in China.
- **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus/Overlooked. While the agreement allows sales, Beijing actively discouraging the use of H20 chips introduces a new and potentially significant headwind that may not be fully factored into all bullish forecasts for China revenue.

**7. Snippet:** "Nvidia previously warned of an $8 billion hit to Q2 results from these restrictions. The company received approval to export its H20 chip to China after months of restrictions. Investors want updates on how this affects full-year guidance."
- **Date:** 2025-08-27
- **Source:** The Economic Times
- **Impact:** Medium. This reiterates the prior impact of restrictions and emphasizes the importance of forward guidance regarding China sales under the new agreement.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known. NVIDIA's previous warning about the $8 billion hit was public information. The focus on full-year guidance is also a common analyst concern.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings call will be heavily scrutinized for details surrounding the recently enacted 15% US revenue sharing agreement on its advanced AI chip sales to China. This agreement, confirmed in August 2025, allows NVIDIA to resume shipments of its H20 chips, a positive development after previous export curbs led to a significant $4.5 billion charge and a plunge in gross margins to 60.5% in Q1 FY2026.

However, the financial impact on gross margins is a key area of non-consensus. While the agreement itself is widely known, analysts offer varying projections. Some warn of a substantial 5-15 percentage point cut to gross margins, with more specific estimates suggesting an 8-10% reduction, costing NVIDIA approximately $2.7 billion annually. In response, NVIDIA reportedly plans to raise prices on its China-specific Blackwell chips (B30A) by 18% to counter the mandate, which may still result in a slight gross margin reduction from 71% to 69.3%. This proactive pricing strategy, if successful, could mitigate some of the direct margin erosion.

A critical, potentially overlooked factor is the reported urging by Beijing for local companies to avoid NVIDIA's H20 processors, even with the export licenses. This suggests a demand-side challenge that could limit the actual revenue recovery from China, despite the lifting of export restrictions. While the H20 re-ramp was expected to contribute up to $8 billion in revenue, this reported pushback from Beijing could significantly dampen those expectations.

China represented 13% of NVIDIA's revenue in FY2025, and the ability to regain this market is crucial. However, the combination of the 15% revenue share, the need for price increases, and the growing competition from domestic Chinese AI chip manufacturers like Cambricon (which saw a 4,348% year-over-year revenue surge in H1 2025) presents a complex picture. NVIDIA's market share in China is already projected to decline from 66% in 2024 to 54% in 2025.

Investors will be looking for clear guidance on Q3 FY2026 and beyond, specifically how NVIDIA expects the revenue-sharing agreement to translate into actual sales and profitability in China, and how the company plans to address the increasing domestic competition and potential government-led boycotts of its chips. The recovery of gross margins to the targeted mid-70% range, after the Q1 dip, will be a key metric to watch, with the China situation posing a significant headwind.
