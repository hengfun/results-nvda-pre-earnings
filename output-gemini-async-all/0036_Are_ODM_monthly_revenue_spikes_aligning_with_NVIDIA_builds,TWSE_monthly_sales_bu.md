## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a review of its key Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) reveals robust performance, largely driven by strong demand for AI servers. While the market widely anticipates strong AI-driven growth for NVIDIA, the magnitude and specific details from these supply chain partners could offer material, non-consensus insights into the quarter's performance and future guidance.

**Key Findings from ODM Reports (Q2 FY2026 - Quarter Ending July 2025):**

*   **Wiwynn's Explosive AI Server Growth:** Wiwynn, a significant server ODM, reported a consolidated revenue of NT$220.744 billion for Q2 2025, marking an exceptional 184.9% increase year-over-year. This surge was "driven primarily by strong demand for general and AI servers." The company's profit after tax also increased by 158.3% year-over-year, and its first-half 2025 revenue of NT$391.399 billion has already surpassed its full-year 2024 total, indicating an accelerated demand trajectory. Wiwynn remains optimistic about long-term data center market demand and is committed to continuous investments in AI, computing, and thermal technologies.,

*   **Quanta Computer's Increasing AI Server Mix:** Quanta Computer, another major ODM, demonstrated strong year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. Its June 2025 sales skyrocketed by 70.6% year-over-year to NT$189.9 billion. While July 2025 revenue saw a 16.6% month-over-month decrease to NT$158.342 billion, it still represented a 27.4% year-over-year increase. Critically, Quanta reported in its Q1 2025 earnings call that AI server sales more than doubled year-over-year, contributing over 60% of overall server sales, with this mix expected to rise to 70% in Q2 2025.,,,,

*   **Inventec's AI Server Expansion Plans:** Inventec reported a Q2 2025 revenue of TWD 186,577.39 million, an increase from TWD 154,158.8 million a year ago, with profit up 21% year-over-year. The company's first-half 2025 consolidated revenue rose 21% year-over-year to NT$343.61 billion. Looking ahead, Inventec expects growth momentum to continue in the second half, fueled by demand for AI-related products. Notably, the company approved a significant NT$4.8 billion investment in Thailand for a new factory to increase AI server and notebook production, with new capacity expected to come online early next year.,

**Analysis of Material Impact and Consensus Check:**

The consistently strong year-over-year revenue growth reported by these key ODMs, particularly Wiwynn's near-tripling of revenue and Quanta's significant AI server contribution, strongly suggests robust underlying demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs during Q2 FY2026. While analysts generally expect strong performance from NVIDIA's data center segment (projected to grow around 53% year-over-year to $40.19 billion,), the sheer scale of growth reported by these ODMs, especially Wiwynn's 184.9% YoY, could indicate that the demand for NVIDIA's AI solutions might be even stronger than the current consensus estimates.

Inventec's forward-looking investment in new AI server production capacity in Thailand, expected to be operational early next year, provides a strong signal for sustained, long-term demand beyond the immediate quarter. This proactive expansion by a major ODM suggests confidence in a prolonged AI infrastructure build-out, which directly benefits NVIDIA.

The month-over-month decline in Quanta's July revenue, while still showing strong year-over-year growth, could be a point of minor concern if not attributed to typical seasonality or pull-ins from earlier in the quarter. However, the overall trend from all three ODMs points to an exceptionally strong quarter for AI server demand.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "In the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, consolidated revenue reached NT$220.744 billion, an increase of 184.9% year-over-year. Profit after tax (PAT) was NT$12.122 billion, up 158.3% year-over-year. Driven primarily by strong demand for general and AI servers..."
    *   **Date:** August 8, 2025
    *   **Source:** Wiwynn Reports Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results, Wiwynn IR Page
    *   **Impact:** High. Wiwynn's nearly 185% YoY revenue growth, explicitly attributed to AI servers, significantly exceeds general market expectations for server growth and could imply stronger-than-consensus demand for NVIDIA's GPUs.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While strong AI server demand is consensus, the magnitude of Wiwynn's growth and its direct attribution to AI servers might be higher than what's fully priced into NVIDIA's current estimates.

*   **Snippet:** "AI server sales grew more than double YoY, contributing over 60% of overall server sales, with the mix expected to rise to 70% in Q2."
    *   **Date:** May 25, 2025 (Q1 2025 Earnings Call)
    *   **Source:** Quanta Computer Inc. (2382) Q1 2025 Earnings – Full Coverage, YouTube (Alpha Spread summary of call)
    *   **Impact:** High. Quanta's projection of AI servers reaching 70% of its total server sales in Q2 indicates a rapid and substantial shift towards AI-specific hardware, directly benefiting NVIDIA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the specific 70% mix for Q2 provides concrete, strong data that reinforces the bullish AI server narrative. The rapid increase in mix might still be underappreciated.

*   **Snippet:** "Inventec on Tuesday reported its highest second-quarter profit in seven years, driven by gains from AMD's sale of its ZT plant despite foreign exchange losses. The contract manufacturer posted after-tax profit attributable to the parent company of NT$2.19 billion (US$73 million) for Q2, up 29% from the previous quarter and 21% year-on-year... The board also approved two major investment projects in Thailand worth NT$4.8 billion... The expansion aims to increase AI server and notebook production, with new capacity expected to come online early next year."
    *   **Date:** August 13, 2025
    *   **Source:** Taiwan's Inventec Q2 profit hits 7-year high, Taiwan News
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. While Q2 revenue growth was more modest than Wiwynn's, the significant investment in new AI server production capacity for early next year signals strong long-term demand and commitment from a key ODM, which is a positive forward-looking indicator for NVIDIA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Inventec's Q2 results are known, the specific details of the NT$4.8 billion investment for future AI server capacity expansion might not be fully integrated into short-term NVIDIA earnings models.

*   **Snippet:** "Quanta's sales in June increased significantly by 70.6%. Total sales for June amounted to NT$189.9 billion."
    *   **Date:** July 8, 2025
    *   **Source:** Quanta Computer (2382) Earnings Surge: June Sales Skyrocket by 70.6% to NT$189.9 Billion, Smartkarma
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This strong month-over-month and year-over-year growth for June, a key month in NVIDIA's Q2, indicates robust order fulfillment and demand for Quanta's products, including AI servers.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This data point is likely factored into broader supply chain analysis.

*   **Snippet:** "Despite the annual growth, July revenue decreased by 16.6% compared to the previous month. For the period from January to July, Quanta's revenue surged by 65.6% year-on-year."
    *   **Date:** August 8, 2025
    *   **Source:** Quanta Computer (2382) Earnings Surge: July Sales Jump 27% Y/Y to NT$158.34 Billion, Smartkarma
    *   **Impact:** Medium. The month-over-month decline in July could be seen as a slight deceleration, but the strong year-over-year growth and overall H1 performance suggest it might be seasonal or a normalization after a strong June. It's a data point to monitor for any signs of softening demand.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. Analysts would likely have noted this monthly fluctuation.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

There are no direct contradictions in the ODM reports; all indicate strong demand for AI servers. The primary gap is the lack of explicit, direct statements from these ODMs linking their revenue spikes *specifically* to NVIDIA's GPU builds for Q2 FY2026. However, given NVIDIA's dominant position in the AI GPU market, and the ODMs' explicit mentions of "AI servers" as a key growth driver, the correlation is highly implied. The month-over-month dip in Quanta's July revenue could be a minor concern if it signals anything beyond normal seasonality, but the overall picture remains very positive.
