## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), my objective is to identify material, non-consensus information likely to impact the company's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance, due after market close today, August 27, 2025. My research focused on GPU hourly rates on cloud spot markets (AWS, Azure, GCP) post-July 2025, prioritizing content published within the last three months.

While direct, explicit "rising or falling" trends for GPU spot hourly rates post-July 2025 from community trackers or GitHub datasets were not definitively found, a significant development in cloud GPU pricing from a major hyperscaler has emerged.

**Key Findings:**

1.  **AWS Reduces NVIDIA GPU Instance Prices:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced significant price reductions, up to 45%, across several high-performance NVIDIA GPU instance families (P4d, P4de, P5, P5en) in June 2025. These reductions apply to On-Demand purchases starting June 1 and Savings Plan purchases effective after June 4. For instance, the p5.48xlarge instance, powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, saw a 44% reduction, dropping from approximately $3.8592 per hour to $2.16 per hour. This move by AWS aims to make high-performance computing (HPC), AI/ML, and generative AI workloads more cost-effective for enterprises.

    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct price reduction for NVIDIA's high-end GPUs on a major cloud platform. While not explicitly spot pricing, a significant cut in on-demand and savings plan rates could influence the broader GPU cloud market. It could signal increased supply of these GPUs, heightened competition among cloud providers, or a strategic move to stimulate demand. For NVIDIA, this could imply lower average selling prices (ASPs) for their GPUs sold to hyperscalers, potentially impacting revenue or margins, or it could lead to higher utilization and increased volume if the lower prices drive greater adoption. The market generally anticipates strong demand and high prices for NVIDIA's latest GPUs, so a price reduction, even if strategic, could be a non-consensus data point.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. While the announcement was made, its full implications for NVIDIA's earnings, especially in the context of spot market dynamics, might not be fully priced in. The general market sentiment leading into NVIDIA's earnings is one of "insatiable demand" and high prices. A significant price reduction by a major customer like AWS could challenge this narrative.

2.  **Dynamic Nature of Cloud Spot Prices:** AWS Spot Instance prices are dynamic and adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply and demand, fluctuating continuously with an average of 197 distinct monthly price changes for GPU and non-GPU instances. In contrast, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure offer more predictable spot pricing, with changes occurring a few times a month (GCP averaging 0.35 times/month, Azure 0.76 times/month).

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This highlights the inherent volatility and lack of clear, consistent trends in AWS spot pricing. While it doesn't provide a specific "rising or falling" trend for August 2025, it suggests that any observed price movements on AWS spot markets could be rapid and significant. For NVIDIA, this means that while on-demand prices might be coming down, the spot market remains a highly variable component of cloud GPU consumption, making it difficult to predict its precise impact on overall demand and pricing.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The dynamic nature of spot pricing is a recognized characteristic of cloud computing.

3.  **Sustained High Demand for AI/ML GPUs:** The GPU cloud server rental market is experiencing robust growth, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing (HPC), AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are actively expanding their GPU offerings to meet this demand. Analysts expect massive AI spending by Big Tech companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta) to continue driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, with hyperscaler capital expenditures (capex) projected to reach $315–$365 billion by 2025, with a growing share dedicated to AI systems.

    *   **Impact:** High. This provides crucial context for the AWS price reductions. Despite the price cuts, the underlying demand for NVIDIA's GPUs remains exceptionally strong. This suggests that the price reductions might be a strategic move by AWS to capture more market share or increase utilization rather than a reflection of weakening demand for NVIDIA's products. For NVIDIA, sustained high demand underpins their revenue and guidance, and any indication of this demand wavering would be highly material.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The strong demand for AI GPUs and NVIDIA's central role in this market is a core part of the current investment thesis.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Direct Spot Price Trends:** A significant gap remains in finding explicit, aggregated data from community trackers or GitHub datasets showing clear "rising or falling" trends for GPU spot hourly rates specifically for AWS, Azure, and GCP post-July 2025. While some sources mention spot pricing and its discounts, they do not provide a directional trend for the specified period.
*   **Impact of AWS Price Reductions on Spot Market:** The direct impact of AWS's on-demand and savings plan price reductions on GPU spot prices is not explicitly detailed. It's plausible that lower on-demand prices could reduce the attractiveness of spot instances if the discount gap narrows, or it could free up capacity that eventually impacts spot availability and pricing.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "On June 5th, 2025, Jeff Barr, AWS's Chief Evangelist, shared a major pricing update via his LinkedIn post. The announcement marks a significant shift in how AWS is approaching GPU compute costs, reducing prices by up to 45% across several high-performance GPU instance families. For enterprises scaling AI/ML, high-performance computing (HPC), or generative workloads, this update offers a timely opportunity to rethink both infrastructure design and cost optimization strategies. The Pricing Change — Real Savings, Real Impact. To understand the scale of this update, let's examine the verified pricing reductions. The price reduction applies to On-Demand purchases beginning June 1 and to Savings Plan purchases effective after June 4. Verified Price Reductions by Instance Type: Instance Type, NVIDIA GPUs, On-Demand Reduction, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, Compute Savings Plans. P4d, A100, 33%, 31% (1yr) / 25% (3yr), 31% (1yr). P4de, A100, 33%, 31% (1yr) / 25% (3yr), 31% (1yr). P5, H100, 44%, 45% (3yr), 44% (1yr) / 25% (3yr). P5en, H200, 25%, 26% (3yr), 25% (1yr). Source: AWS Official Announcement, June 2025. To put these reductions in perspective, consider that the p5.48xlarge instance currently costs $3.8592 per hour. With the 44% reduction, this drops to approximately $2.16 per hour—a significant decrease for organizations running intensive AI workloads."
