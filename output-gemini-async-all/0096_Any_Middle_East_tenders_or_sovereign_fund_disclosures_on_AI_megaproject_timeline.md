## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, my objective is to identify material, non-consensus information regarding NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance. Recent web content (last 3 months) reveals significant developments in the Middle East, particularly concerning large-scale AI infrastructure projects involving NVIDIA's advanced chips and sovereign wealth funds. These developments, while generally known that the Middle East is investing in AI, the specific scale, chip types, and timelines of these partnerships may represent non-consensus information that could materially impact NVIDIA's future performance.

### Key Findings: Middle East AI Megaprojects and NVIDIA

**1. Saudi Arabia's HUMAIN (PIF-backed) to Deploy 18,000 NVIDIA GB300/GB200 Blackwell Superchips**

*   **Snippet:** "Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure, targeting a build-out of up to 500 megawatts of AI computing capacity using hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. The move is led by HUMAIN, a Public Investment Fund (PIF)-backed entity tasked with turning the country into a digital powerhouse. The first phase includes the deployment of 18,000 NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips, the company's most advanced AI platform to date."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-17
*   **Source:** Saudi Arabia to Deploy $5B in NVIDIA AI Chips, Fueling Middle East's Largest Data Leap, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High. This is a substantial, concrete order for NVIDIA's latest and most advanced Blackwell chips, directly from a sovereign wealth fund-backed entity. The initial 18,000 chips represent a significant revenue driver, and the long-term plan for "hundreds of thousands" of GPUs over five years indicates a sustained demand pipeline. This scale of deployment could exceed some analyst expectations for Blackwell's early ramp.
*   **Consensus Check:** While general awareness of Saudi Arabia's AI ambitions exists, the specific commitment of 18,000 GB200/GB300 chips for the first phase and the multi-year "hundreds of thousands" target might be overlooked in consensus models, which often focus on hyperscaler demand. The $5 billion investment figure also provides a tangible scale.

**2. Saudi Arabia's PIF-owned HUMAIN to Build AI Factories with NVIDIA, Targeting 500MW Capacity**

*   **Snippet:** "HUMAIN, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund focused on AI, is making a major investment to build AI factories in KSA with a projected capacity of up to 500 megawatts powered by several hundred thousand of NVIDIA's most advanced GPUs over the next five years. The first phase of deployment will be an 18,000 NVIDIA GB300 Grace Blackwell AI supercomputer with NVIDIA InfiniBand networking."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-13
*   **Source:** Saudi Arabia and NVIDIA to Build AI Factories to Power Next Wave of Intelligence for the Age of Reasoning, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** High. This reiterates and expands on the previous point, emphasizing the "AI factories" concept and the long-term vision. The 500-megawatt capacity target over five years signals a massive, sustained infrastructure build-out directly benefiting NVIDIA. The mention of GB300 Grace Blackwell further confirms the high-end nature of the chips.
*   **Consensus Check:** The "AI factories" and "500 megawatts" over five years, powered by "several hundred thousand" GPUs, provide a long-term demand signal that might not be fully incorporated into short-term earnings models. This indicates a foundational, strategic investment rather than a one-off purchase.

**3. UAE's "Stargate Project" to be Powered by Thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell GB300 Chips**

*   **Snippet:** "These developments are part of the newly initiated “Stargate Project”, a newly announced AI supercomputing cluster to be constructed by the UAE's G42 in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The project is expected to collaborate with its US counterpart, which was initiated earlier this year by Donald Trump. The first development stage will include building a 1-gigawatt computing hub, while the target is to reach a 5-gigawatt capacity and cover over 25.9 square kilometres. Nvidia is set to supply thousands of its advanced Blackwell GB300 chips to power the Stargate hub, enabling large-scale AI model training."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-21

*   **Impact:** High. The UAE's "Stargate Project" is another massive AI infrastructure initiative, with NVIDIA supplying "thousands" of advanced Blackwell GB300 chips. The ambitious target of a 5-gigawatt capacity underscores the long-term, significant demand from the UAE.
*   **Consensus Check:** Similar to Saudi Arabia, the sheer scale and the specific mention of "thousands" of GB300 chips for a new, multi-gigawatt project in the UAE could be underappreciated. The involvement of G42 and the "Stargate Project" name might be known, but the direct NVIDIA chip commitment and scale are key.

**4. Potential for 500,000 Advanced NVIDIA Chips Annually for UAE (2025-2027)**

*   **Snippet:** "The US is reportedly eyeing a setup that could allow mns of Nvidia chips to be imported by the UAE, which would far exceed the limits in place since former US President Joe Biden's AI export curbs, Bloomberg reported separately, citing sources familiar with the matter. The potential agreement — which is still being discussed — could let the UAE import 500k of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, according to the sources. One-fifth of those would go to state AI firm G42, while the remainder would go to US companies building data centers in the UAE, according to the people."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-14
*   **Source:** UAE could be in line for more Nvidia chips as Trump's visit to the region comes with blockbuster agreements, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Very High. This snippet suggests a potential, massive increase in NVIDIA's chip exports to the UAE, far exceeding previous restrictions. An annual import of 500,000 "most advanced chips" for three years (2025-2027) would be a game-changer for NVIDIA's revenue, particularly if these are high-value Blackwell-class chips. This is a forward-looking indicator of significant, sustained demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is highly non-consensus. While the easing of export curbs is known, the specific potential volume of 500,000 advanced chips annually for the UAE is a staggering figure that is unlikely to be fully factored into current analyst models, especially given it's still a "potential agreement."

**5. Mubadala's MGX Co-led $30 Billion AI Infrastructure Partnership with NVIDIA**

*   **Snippet:** "In the technology sector, MGX, in September last year, co-led a Dh110. 2 billion AI infrastructure partnership with Microsoft, BlackRock, GIP, Nvidia and xAI, and invested in companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Databricks."
*   **Date:** 2025-05-08
*   **Source:** Mubadala asset base grows to $326bn on AI and future-focused investments | The National, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium. While the partnership was co-led "last September" (implying September 2024), the continued reporting in May 2025 highlights Mubadala's ongoing commitment to AI infrastructure and NVIDIA's role within this significant $30 billion partnership. It reinforces the strategic importance of NVIDIA to major sovereign wealth funds.
*   **Consensus Check:** The existence of MGX and its AI investments might be generally known in financial circles, but the specific details of NVIDIA's involvement in a $30 billion partnership alongside other tech giants might not be fully appreciated as a direct, ongoing revenue stream for NVIDIA.

**6. NVIDIA Partners with Qatari Telecom Ooredoo for AI Deployment Amid Export Curbs**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has reportedly struck a deal to deploy its artificial intelligence (AI) technology in Qatari-owned data centers located in multiple countries across the Middle East. In a June 24 Reuters report, the CEO of Qatari telecom group Ooredoo, Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, said that the deal will make the company the first in the region to open the doors for its clients to gain direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics technology."
*   **Date:** 2024-06-24
*   **Source:** Nvidia launches in Middle East amid US AI export clampdown: Report - Cointelegraph, [URL not provided in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Medium. This deal signifies NVIDIA's expansion into another key Middle Eastern market (Qatar and its regional clients) despite export restrictions. While the specific technology and financial details are undisclosed, Ooredoo's plan to invest over $1 billion in data centers and triple capacity by the end of the decade suggests a growing, long-term demand for NVIDIA's AI solutions.
*   **Consensus Check:** This deal, reported in late June, might be more recent and less integrated into consensus estimates, especially given the lack of specific financial figures. The competitive advantage Ooredoo gains ("18 to 24 months") suggests a significant, early-mover advantage with NVIDIA's tech.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Chip Specificity:** Some reports mention GB200 Blackwell, while others mention GB300 Grace Blackwell for the Saudi deals. While both are advanced Blackwell-generation chips, a precise clarification on the exact models and their mix would be beneficial.
*   **Financial Details:** While the Saudi deal mentions a "$5 billion investment" and the Mubadala partnership is $30 billion, the specific revenue NVIDIA will recognize from these deals, and over what exact timeframe, is not fully detailed. The Ooredoo deal's financial terms are entirely undisclosed.
*   **Timeline Granularity:** While "next five years" and "2025-2027" are mentioned, more granular timelines for chip deliveries and revenue recognition within NVIDIA's fiscal quarters would be valuable for precise earnings modeling.
*   **"Non-Consensus" Definition:** The term "non-consensus" is relative. While the general trend of Middle East AI investment is known, the specific scale and details of these multi-billion dollar, multi-year commitments, especially the potential 500k annual chip imports for the UAE, are likely to be beyond what is fully factored into current analyst models.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is poised to benefit significantly from the burgeoning "sovereign AI" initiatives across the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These nations, flush with capital from their sovereign wealth funds (PIF and Mubadala), are making multi-billion dollar, multi-year commitments to build out massive AI infrastructure.

In Saudi Arabia, the PIF-backed entity HUMAIN is leading a charge to deploy an initial 18,000 of NVIDIA's most advanced GB200/GB300 Blackwell superchips as part of a larger plan for "hundreds of thousands" of GPUs over the next five years, targeting a 500-megawatt AI computing capacity. This represents a foundational, long-term revenue stream for NVIDIA's Data Center segment.

Similarly, the UAE's "Stargate Project," spearheaded by G42, is set to become a 5-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster, with NVIDIA supplying "thousands" of Blackwell GB300 chips. Crucially, there are reports of a potential agreement that could allow the UAE to import an astonishing 500,000 of the "most advanced chips" annually from 2025 to 2027, a figure that would dramatically exceed previous export restrictions and could significantly boost NVIDIA's forward guidance.

Beyond these two major players, NVIDIA has also secured a deal with Qatari telecom Ooredoo to deploy its AI technology across data centers in multiple Middle Eastern countries. While the financial specifics are undisclosed, Ooredoo's planned $1 billion investment and capacity expansion signal a growing regional demand for NVIDIA's solutions.

These developments are largely enabled by a recent relaxation of US export restrictions on advanced semiconductors to "intermediary" nations in the Middle East. While the overall narrative of strong AI demand is consensus, the sheer scale, specific chip types (Blackwell generation), and the multi-year, multi-billion dollar nature of these sovereign fund-backed projects, especially the potential 500,000 annual chip imports for the UAE, are likely to be underappreciated by the market. This non-consensus information suggests a robust and sustained demand pipeline for NVIDIA's high-end AI chips, which could lead to positive surprises in upcoming earnings reports and forward guidance.
