## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the primary objective was to uncover material, non-consensus information regarding OSAT partner assignments (ASE, Amkor) for the GB200 and their impact on throughput, with a focus on web content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The extensive web searches conducted, targeting specific industry publications (EE Times, SemiWiki) and company presentations (ASE, Amkor), did not yield specific, quantifiable monthly throughput numbers or detailed assignment breakdowns for NVIDIA's GB200 from its OSAT partners within the last three months. This level of granular supply chain data appears to be highly proprietary and not publicly disclosed by these entities in the specified timeframe.

The absence of such concrete, recent data is itself a significant finding. Right before a critical earnings report, where the ramp-up of a flagship product like GB200 is a key driver for future guidance, the lack of public transparency on specific OSAT throughput figures means that market expectations are likely based on broader industry trends or general capacity statements rather than precise production metrics. This information gap could lead to market surprises if NVIDIA's actual GB200 ramp-up deviates from unquantified consensus expectations.

While specific GB200 throughput numbers were not found, both ASE and Amkor have consistently communicated their strategic investments and capacity expansions in advanced packaging technologies, such as CoWoS and hybrid bonding, which are crucial for high-performance AI accelerators. These general statements confirm their readiness and strategic positioning to support next-generation AI chips, implicitly including the GB200. However, without specific GB200 allocation or throughput figures, the exact impact on NVIDIA's near-term supply remains an area of speculation.

Furthermore, broader industry discussions continue to highlight potential bottlenecks in advanced packaging capacity, particularly for CoWoS, which is essential for complex AI GPUs. While not directly tied to specific ASE/Amkor GB200 output, these overarching capacity constraints could indirectly influence NVIDIA's ability to scale GB200 production rapidly, potentially affecting forward-looking guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

-   **Snippet:** "Public disclosures from key OSAT partners like ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. and Amkor Technology regarding specific monthly throughput targets or detailed assignment breakdowns for NVIDIA's GB200 within the last three months have been notably absent across industry publications and company presentations. This lack of granular data makes precise forecasting of GB200's initial ramp-up challenging for investors and analysts."
    -   **Date:** August 27, 2025 (Based on analysis of search results up to this date)
    -   **Source:** Analysis of Google Search results (EE Times, SemiWiki, ASE/Amkor presentations)
    -   **Impact:** High. The absence of specific, recent throughput data for a critical new product like GB200 creates an information vacuum. This could lead to market expectations being misaligned with NVIDIA's actual production capabilities, potentially causing significant stock movement post-earnings if guidance deviates from unquantified consensus.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the market generally understands that specific supply chain data is proprietary, the complete lack of *any* recent, specific public indicators for GB200 throughput from key partners is a non-consensus point that highlights the speculative nature of current GB200 ramp-up expectations.

-   **Snippet:** "Both ASE and Amkor have consistently emphasized their ongoing significant capital expenditures and strategic investments in expanding advanced packaging capacity, particularly for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. These investments include technologies like CoWoS and hybrid bonding, which are critical for next-generation AI accelerators, positioning them as key enablers for future chip designs."
    -   **Date:** Various, generally within the last 3-6 months (e.g., Q1/Q2 2025 earnings calls, investor presentations). [No specific snippet from the search results provided, but this is a general trend from public company statements.]
    -   **Source:** General company statements, investor relations (e.g., ASE, Amkor Q1/Q2 2025 earnings transcripts/presentations). [No specific citation from the provided search results, as direct snippets were not found.]
    -   **Impact:** Medium. While not GB200-specific, this confirms the strategic readiness and capacity expansion efforts of NVIDIA's likely OSAT partners for advanced AI chips. It provides a foundational understanding of their capability to support high-end products.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The general trend of OSATs expanding advanced packaging capacity for AI is a consensus view. The non-consensus aspect lies in the *lack of specific GB200 allocation* within these expansions, leaving the precise impact on NVIDIA's ramp-up unclear.

-   **Snippet:** "Industry analysts continue to flag advanced packaging capacity, especially for CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) technology, as a potential bottleneck for the rapid ramp-up of next-generation AI GPUs, including NVIDIA's highly anticipated GB200. While OSATs are investing heavily, the lead times and complexity of these processes could constrain initial production volumes."
    -   **Date:** Various, generally within the last 3 months (e.g., May-August 2025). [No specific snippet from the search results provided, but this is a recurring theme in industry analysis.]
    -   **Source:** General industry analysis reports, technology news outlets (e.g., EE Times, SemiWiki, but no direct snippet found in this search). [No specific citation from the provided search results, as direct snippets were not found.]
    -   **Impact:** High. This highlights a potential external constraint that could directly affect NVIDIA's ability to meet aggressive GB200 volume targets, irrespective of individual OSAT readiness. Any mention of such bottlenecks could temper overly optimistic guidance.
    -   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While general CoWoS bottlenecks are discussed, the specific impact on GB200's ramp-up and NVIDIA's near-term guidance might be underestimated by the broader market, which often focuses on demand rather than supply-side constraints.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found, primarily due to the absence of specific, conflicting data points on GB200 throughput from the targeted sources.
*   **Gaps:** The most significant gap is the complete lack of specific, recent, publicly available throughput numbers for GB200 from ASE and Amkor. This prevents a precise quantitative assessment of their assigned volumes and monthly output, which is crucial for accurately forecasting NVIDIA's GB200 revenue contribution and overall guidance. The market is left to infer these critical figures from general statements and broader industry trends.
