## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, and recent insights from key UPS and battery vendors, Eaton and Vertiv, highlight both robust demand for AI infrastructure and emerging bottlenecks that could influence NVIDIA's near-term deployment trajectory. While both companies reported strong financial performance driven by AI, the increasing power density requirements and grid capacity limitations are leading to significant project delays and supply chain constraints for critical infrastructure components.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The overarching theme from Eaton and Vertiv's recent earnings is a booming demand for data center infrastructure, directly fueled by the artificial intelligence revolution. Eaton reported a remarkable 50-55% year-over-year increase in data center sales and orders in Q2 2025, while Vertiv saw its net sales surge 35% with a robust $8.5 billion backlog, up 21% from the previous year. These figures underscore the massive underlying investment in AI computing capabilities, which is a strong positive indicator for NVIDIA's GPU sales.

However, this explosive growth is not without its challenges. The sheer power demands of AI data centers, which can consume 10-50 times more power per rack than traditional facilities (with some reaching 200 kilowatts per rack), are creating significant hurdles. Power availability has emerged as the "primary bottleneck" for AI data centers, with many regions lacking the electrical infrastructure to support hyperscale deployments. This is leading to substantial delays, with some companies experiencing pushouts of AI projects by 6-18 months due due to power shortages.

Vertiv, a leader in cooling solutions, specifically for NVIDIA GPUs, is experiencing an 18-month backlog for its liquid cooling technologies, indicating that demand is outstripping supply for these essential components. This suggests that even if NVIDIA can produce its GPUs, their deployment could be slowed by the availability of adequate cooling infrastructure. Furthermore, the broader supply chain for power delivery components, such as high-efficiency power supplies, circuit breakers, and transformers, is also facing shortages, contributing to construction bottlenecks.

NVIDIA is actively addressing these challenges through strategic partnerships. Eaton announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to develop high-voltage direct current power infrastructure for AI data centers, aiming to support "1 megawatt racks and beyond" and integrate with NVIDIA's Omniverse Blueprint. This proactive step by NVIDIA to work with power management leaders demonstrates the critical nature of these infrastructure constraints and NVIDIA's commitment to enabling future high-density AI deployments.

In summary, while the demand for AI infrastructure remains exceptionally strong, as evidenced by the financial performance of Eaton and Vertiv, the increasing power and cooling requirements are creating significant bottlenecks in the form of project delays and supply chain constraints. These factors could impact the rate at which NVIDIA's GPUs are deployed, potentially influencing forward-looking guidance, even as underlying demand remains robust.
