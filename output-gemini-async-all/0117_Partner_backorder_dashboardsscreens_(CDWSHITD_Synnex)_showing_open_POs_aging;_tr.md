## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into recent partner and supply chain disclosures reveals several material, non-consensus insights that could influence the company's performance and forward-looking guidance. While the overarching narrative remains one of robust demand for NVIDIA's AI accelerators, specific nuances regarding China sales, Blackwell GPU supply, and partner ordering patterns suggest potential areas of both upside and caution.

### Structured Findings

**1. China H20 Sales Reversal: Short-Term Boost, Long-Term Questions**

*   **Snippet:** "In mid-July, Nvidia announced that the U.S. government would grant export licenses for the H20 (and equivalent AMD) chips to China. Huang went on Chinese TV and said licenses are assured and that Nvidia “hopes to start deliveries soon”. In practice, this means NVDA can finally ship the backlog of Chinese orders. Analysts immediately saw this as a game-changer. Melius Research (via the news) called Nvidia's “getting back in China after a mid-Apr ban” a “huge tailwind”... Another firm estimated that roughly $10 billion of H20-related inventory could be monetized once shipments resume, potentially adding $0.30 to FY2026 EPS. In short, the worst of China's headwind may have passed. For Q2, some of those unshipped H20 GPUs may finally contribute to revenue, which could lift results well above the conservative $45 billion guidance."
*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA has resumed sales of its AI chip H20 in China, prioritizing this year's targets. TSMC's production capacity could be a bottleneck. Currently, no significant additional orders; upstream supply chain like TSMC's full capacity could be a bottleneck. NVIDIA's existing product stock and TSMC's semi-finished inventory will be the supply mainstay upon H20's restart."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025, July 22, 2025
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, TrendForce
*   **Impact:** High. The mid-July reversal of the H20 export ban to China could provide an unexpected revenue boost for Q2 FY2026 by allowing NVIDIA to clear its existing backlog of Chinese orders, potentially exceeding its conservative $45 billion guidance. However, the TrendForce report indicates "no significant additional orders" for H20 and highlights TSMC's full capacity as a potential bottleneck for future new orders. This suggests that while a short-term backlog clearance may provide upside, sustained new demand from China might be more constrained than some optimistic market views.
*   **Consensus Check:** The ban reversal is widely known, but the immediate revenue impact for Q2 and the nuanced outlook on *new* orders from China, particularly concerning TSMC's capacity, could be overlooked by the broader market.

**2. Blackwell GPU Supply Constraints Amid Robust Demand**

*   **Snippet:** "UBS also highlighted the strong demand backdrop for Nvidia chips. Supply chain checks support this optimism, with GPU production estimated up 20% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and another 30% in Q3, underpinning expectations for roughly 5 million units shipped this year at an approximately $33,000 average selling price in the compute segment. UBS notes that while supply appears sufficient, demand remains the bigger question, citing delays in flagship models like Deepseek R2 due to limited H20 availability."
*   **Snippet:** "Limited Blackwell GPU supply (few thousand units/quarter) raises doubts about scaling to meet hyperscaler needs."
*   **Snippet:** "Lead times for Blackwell GPUs have already stretched into 2026, indicating robust demand."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025, August 27, 2025, August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** Proactive Investors, AInvest
*   **Impact:** Medium-High. While overall GPU production is increasing significantly (20% QoQ in Q2, 30% in Q3), the limited supply of Blackwell GPUs (a few thousand units per quarter) and lead times extending into 2026 suggest that NVIDIA may still be supply-constrained on its most advanced products. The specific mention of delays in flagship models like Deepseek R2 due to H20 availability (despite the H20 ban reversal) indicates that supply chain complexities, potentially including HBM memory, could temper the pace at which the most cutting-edge AI chips reach customers, potentially impacting the full realization of demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Strong demand for Blackwell is consensus, but the specific details on limited initial supply and extended lead times, coupled with the H20 availability impacting other flagship models, might be underappreciated.

**3. Partner "Advanced Purchases" Signal Potential Demand Pull-Forward**

*   **Snippet:** "Our Advanced Solutions portfolio grew gross billings 12% year-over-year, 10% year-over-year when excluding the impact of Hyve, driven by accelerated demand for data center infrastructure and continued growth in cloud, security, AI and other high-growth technologies. ... And in addition to that, we believe we were modestly aided by our customers advancing their forecasted purchases in light of a volatile economic environment."
*   **Snippet:** "we believe the quarter benefited from some demand pulled. forward. within TDC next excluding Hive gross billings grew 11% yearover-year. and operating margins expanded resulting in strong operating income growth. from a technology perspective. we saw strong growth. across both endpoint."
*   **Date:** June 24, 2025
*   **Source:** Seeking Alpha, YouTube (TD Synnex Earnings Call Transcript)
*   **Impact:** Medium. TD Synnex, a significant NVIDIA distribution partner, reported strong Q2 FY2025 growth in its Advanced Solutions, driven by data center and AI demand. However, the company also noted that it was "modestly aided by our customers advancing their forecasted purchases in light of a volatile economic environment" and that the quarter "benefited from some demand pulled forward". This suggests that some demand originally expected in future quarters may have been accelerated into Q2 FY2025. While positive for the current quarter, this could imply a potential moderation in growth for subsequent quarters if the pull-forward effect is significant and not offset by new demand drivers.
*   **Consensus Check:** This specific detail from a key distribution partner about demand pull-forward is likely non-consensus and could lead to questions about the sustainability of growth rates in the near-term future, despite strong underlying AI demand.

**4. Strong Infrastructure Spending by Partners**

*   **Snippet:** "Hardware increased by 9%, with significant increases in infrastructure solutions, and software grew by 16%, driven by areas like telephony and application suites."
*   **Snippet:** "While the initial recovery was largely driven by client devices, CDW's 2Q25 results revealed a significant and positive development: the refresh cycle has now extended into mission-critical infrastructure solutions. This is very important because it paints a picture of a much healthier spending environment. For reference, hardware sales grew 9% y/y (led by a strong 12% y/y growth in client devices such as notebooks, mobile devices, and desktops), but Netcomm and Servers both grew even faster by meaningful double-digits (per the 2Q25 earnings call)."
*   **Date:** August 6, 2025
*   **Source:** AInvest, Seeking Alpha
*   **Impact:** Low-Medium. CDW's Q2 2025 earnings show strong growth in hardware sales, particularly in "infrastructure solutions" and "Netcomm and Servers" which grew by "meaningful double-digits". This indirectly supports the strong demand for NVIDIA's data center GPUs, as they are critical components in these infrastructure build-outs. While this confirms a healthy spending environment, it aligns more with the general consensus of robust AI infrastructure investment rather than providing a non-consensus view on NVIDIA's specific backorders or aging POs.
*   **Consensus Check:** This reinforces the consensus view of strong AI-driven infrastructure spending.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **China H20 Impact:** There's a contradiction between the expectation of clearing a significant backlog of H20 chips for Q2 FY2026 revenue upside and the TrendForce report indicating "no significant additional orders" for H20 and TSMC's full capacity as a bottleneck. This suggests that while past orders might boost current results, the pipeline for new China-specific orders might be less robust or more constrained than anticipated.
*   **Blackwell Supply:** While overall GPU production is ramping up, the "limited to a few thousand units per quarter" for Blackwell and extended lead times contradict the idea of "supply appears sufficient" for demand. This highlights a potential bottleneck for NVIDIA's newest and most powerful chips, which could cap upside even with insatiable demand.
*   **Direct Partner Backorder Data:** The primary research query for "Partner backorder dashboards/screens (CDW/SHI/TD Synnex) showing open POs aging; trend vs June" could not be directly fulfilled through public web searches. The findings are based on indirect statements from partner earnings calls and industry reports. This remains a significant information gap.
