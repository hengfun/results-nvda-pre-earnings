## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis for NVIDIA (NVDA), focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact its Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance for Q3 FY2026.

### Human-Readable Analysis

NVIDIA is reporting its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, and the market is keenly focused on its guidance for Q3 FY2026, particularly concerning the ramp-up of its Blackwell platform and the easing of supply bottlenecks. While overall demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs remains robust, several nuanced developments, especially within the Taiwanese supply chain and the critical Chinese market, could present non-consensus impacts.

A significant, potentially overlooked factor is the recent halt in production of NVIDIA's H20 AI chip, designed for the Chinese market. This decision, reportedly influenced by pressure from Beijing and security concerns raised by Chinese regulators, comes despite the US government having recently approved H20 exports under a revenue-sharing agreement. This creates considerable uncertainty for NVIDIA's China revenue, a market that previously saw a surge in H20 orders after the initial ban was lifted. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, has indicated a substantial H20 inventory, suggesting a potential overhang if demand in China does not materialize as expected due to these new security concerns.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA is developing a Blackwell Ultra-based chip, the B30A, as a potential successor for China. However, this chip still requires US government approval, and commercial shipments are not expected until late 2025 or early 2026. This timeline suggests that any significant revenue contribution from a new China-specific, high-performance chip is still several quarters away, leaving a potential gap in the interim given the H20's uncertain future.

On the supply side, TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging capacity remains a critical bottleneck for AI chips. While TSMC is aggressively expanding capacity, aiming for 70,000-80,000 wafers per month by December 2025 and 90,000 by 2026, NVIDIA is expected to consume a substantial portion (up to 60%) of this. The transition of NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs to the more advanced CoWoS-L technology is underway, which is an expansion of capability rather than a reduction in overall capacity. However, the persistent "choke point" status of CoWoS means that even with expansion, any minor disruption or unexpected surge in competitor demand could still impact NVIDIA's ability to fully meet its own demand, particularly for the highly anticipated Blackwell GPUs, whose demand is expected to exceed supply into fiscal 2026.

Finally, the competitive landscape in China is evolving. Huawei's Ascend 910C chip is reportedly set to mass ship in September 2025 and is seen as rivaling NVIDIA's H20 for AI inference tasks. Concurrently, the Chinese market is seeing a surge in second-hand NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs following the H20 ban, indicating a shift towards alternative sourcing and domestic solutions. These developments suggest that even if NVIDIA navigates the regulatory hurdles, its market share and pricing power in China could face increasing pressure.

In summary, while strong overall AI demand and TSMC's capacity expansion are positive, the immediate and forward-looking outlook for NVIDIA's China business, coupled with the persistent CoWoS bottleneck and emerging competition, presents material non-consensus risks that investors should consider ahead of the earnings report.

### Structured Findings

**1. Snippet:** "Nvidia has reportedly halted production of its H20 AI chip following pressure from Beijing, which urged local companies to avoid using it. This decision comes amid rising tensions between the US and China over access to leading AI technology. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently visited Taiwan, stating his "main purpose coming here is to discuss our new product plans and strategy." His visit came as reports emerged that Nvidia has ordered key suppliers, including Foxconn, Samsung Electronics, and Amkor Technology, to halt production of its H20 AI chip designed for the Chinese market."
**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Source:** The Times of India, [URL not provided in snippet]
**Impact:** High.
**Reasoning:** This is highly material as it directly impacts NVIDIA's revenue from the crucial Chinese market for a chip specifically designed to comply with export rules. A production halt, especially after the US government eased restrictions, indicates significant geopolitical and security-related headwinds that could lead to a substantial revenue miss or a more conservative Q3 FY2026 guidance for China.
**Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While US-China tensions are known, the specific halt of H20 production *after* the ban was lifted and due to *Chinese* pressure/security concerns is a new, non-consensus development that could surprise the market.

**2. Snippet:** "On July 31, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) reportedly summoned Nvidia after allegations that its H20 chips sold in China contained potential security backdoors. What's more, according to Reuters, the CAC also called in firms such as Tencent and ByteDance, urging them to justify their H20 purchases and prioritize domestic alternatives. Officials explicitly cited the risk that U.S. chips could be embedded with tracking systems, reinforcing fears that reliance on American technology could be exploited as a strategic vulnerability."
**Date:** August 27, 2025
**Source:** The Diplomat, [URL not provided in snippet]
**Impact:** High.
**Reasoning:** This directly explains the "pressure from Beijing" mentioned in the previous snippet and highlights a severe trust issue from Chinese regulators. This could significantly dampen demand for H20 chips in China, even if technically allowed, and force Chinese customers to accelerate their shift to domestic alternatives, impacting NVIDIA's Q3 FY226 outlook and beyond.
**Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific allegations of "security backdoors" and the direct summoning of major Chinese tech firms by the CAC to justify H20 purchases are strong, non-consensus signals of deepening distrust that could severely curtail NVIDIA's China sales.

**3. Snippet:** "Earlier this week, reports emerged that the company was working on a de facto successor to the H20, which will comply with existing export control rules, and could be sold on the Chinese market. The Blackwell Ultra-based B30A is a substantially more powerful chip than the H20, which beats the full-fat H100 in many ways, but remains significantly slower than the B300. Samples are expected to land in September. But the product has yet to be greenlit by the U.S. Government. The earliest that commercial units could be shipped would be by the end of 2025, to early 2026."
**Date:** August 22, 2025
**Source:** Tom's Hardware, [URL not provided in snippet]
**Impact:** Medium to High.
**Reasoning:** While a successor chip (B30A) is in the works, the need for US government approval and a late 2025/early 2026 shipping timeline means there will be a significant gap in NVIDIA's ability to offer a competitive, high-performance AI chip in China, especially given the H20's current issues. This could negatively impact Q3 FY2026 and Q4 FY2026 China revenue projections.
**Consensus Check:** Widely known that NVIDIA is developing new China-specific chips, but the specific timeline for B30A approval and shipment, coupled with the H20's recent troubles, adds a layer of non-consensus uncertainty regarding near-term China revenue.

**4. Snippet:** "By 2026, TSMC's CoWoS production capacity is expected to reach 90,000 wafers per month, up from 35,000 in 2024, ensuring it can meet the surging demand for AI chips."
**Date:** August 27, 2025
**Source:** AInvest, [URL not provided in snippet]
**Impact:** Medium.
**Reasoning:** This provides a clear, recent projection for TSMC's CoWoS capacity expansion. While positive for long-term supply, the "by 2026" timeframe means that CoWoS will remain a bottleneck for Q3 FY226 and potentially into early FY2027. NVIDIA's ability to secure a sufficient share of this ramping capacity is crucial for its Blackwell ramp.
**Consensus Check:** Widely known that TSMC is expanding CoWoS, but the specific August 2025 confirmation of the 90,000 wafers/month by 2026 target, directly relevant to the current earnings period, helps to solidify the expected ramp.

**5. Snippet:** "AI demand remains above supply, with supply constraints continuing for Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell GPUs. The demand for Blackwell is also expected to exceed supply into fiscal 2026, BofA notes, driven by significant investments in AI, a positive indicator for TSMC's business."
**Date:** November 21, 2024 (Note: This is older, but the "into fiscal 2026" part is still relevant for Q3 FY2026 outlook)
**Source:** Investing.com (citing BofA), [URL not provided in snippet]
**Impact:** Medium.
**Reasoning:** This confirms that despite TSMC's capacity expansion, NVIDIA's most advanced GPUs (Blackwell) are still expected to be supply-constrained well into fiscal 2026. This implies that NVIDIA's revenue growth will continue to be limited by supply rather than demand, and any slight hiccup in TSMC's ramp or NVIDIA's allocation could impact guidance.
**Consensus Check:** While general supply constraints are known, the explicit statement that Blackwell demand will *exceed supply into fiscal 2026* provides a more precise and potentially underappreciated long-term constraint.

**6. Snippet:** "Huawei's Ascend 910C chip, scheduled for mass shipment in September 2025, now rivals Nvidia's H20 in AI inference tasks, matching total processing performance and surpassing it in energy efficiency. This achievement is notable given that the 910C is produced using SMIC's 7nm process, which is roughly three years behind TSMC's 2nm technology."
**Date:** August 27, 2025
**Source:** The Diplomat, [URL not provided in snippet]
**Impact:** Medium.
**Reasoning:** The emergence of a competitive domestic alternative (Huawei Ascend 910C) that rivals H20 for inference, especially with mass shipments starting in September 2025, poses a direct threat to NVIDIA's market share in China. This could further reduce demand for NVIDIA's China-specific chips, particularly if Chinese firms are encouraged to prioritize domestic solutions due to security concerns.
**Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While Huawei is known to be developing AI chips, the specific detail of the Ascend 910C matching H20 performance for inference and its imminent mass shipment in September 2025 is a timely, non-consensus competitive threat.
