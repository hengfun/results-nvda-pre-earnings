## Analysis

After conducting extensive web searches for material, non-consensus information regarding MOF/MIIT notices or State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) tenders specifying H20/HX-class NVIDIA chips within the last three months (May 27, 2025, to August 27, 2025), no direct or indirect evidence of such public notices or tenders was found.

The search queries targeted various combinations of "NVIDIA H20 HX," "China," "MIIT," "MOF," "SOE," "tender," "procurement," and specific date ranges (May, June, July, August 2025). The results primarily consisted of irrelevant content, outdated articles (from 2023 or March 2025, which falls outside the specified 3-month window), or general discussions about NVIDIA's consumer-grade GPUs and AMD's AI chip ambitions.

**Analysis of Search Limitations:**

The absence of findings could be attributed to several factors:
*   **Lack of Public Disclosure:** Information regarding the procurement of export-controlled, specialized AI chips by Chinese government entities or SOEs may not be publicly disclosed in easily searchable formats, especially in English.
*   **Niche Reporting:** Such information, if it exists, might be confined to highly specialized industry reports, private intelligence, or Chinese-language government portals that are not indexed by general search engines or were not captured by the specific queries used.
*   **Timing of Tenders:** There might not have been significant new public tenders or MOF/MIIT notices specifically for H20/HX chips within the narrow 3-month window preceding NVIDIA's earnings report. Existing procurement might be under long-term contracts or less frequently announced.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the executed research, there is no material, non-consensus information derived from MOF/MIIT notices or SOE tenders specifying H20/HX-class NVIDIA chips, published within the last three months, that is likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The lack of such public information itself could be a point of consideration, suggesting a continuation of existing supply dynamics rather than new, publicly announced large-scale procurements from these specific channels.
