## Analysis

 attempts from customers have exposed friction points and stifled adoption," the document said. This contradicts the more upbeat outlook Amazon executives have shared about AWS's AI-chip efforts. In an April earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said demand for AWS's custom silicon was "quite high," and his annual shareholder letter this year name-checked a number of early customers, such as Snap, Airbnb, and Anthropic."
*   **Date:** 2024-05-28
*   **Source:** Entrepreneur (via Business Insider), "Inside Amazon's Struggle to Crack Nvidia's AI-Chip Dominance"
*   **Impact:** High. This directly highlights a significant discrepancy between Amazon's internal reality (as per leaked documents) and its public messaging. For NVIDIA, this suggests that while Amazon is *trying* to reduce reliance, the actual adoption and success of their internal chips are not as strong as publicly portrayed, implying continued reliance on NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market likely takes Amazon's public statements at face value. This leak provides a non-consensus view.

**Finding 3: AWS Claims of Cost-Efficiency and Performance for Trainium/Graviton (Public Statements)**
*   **Snippet:** "Compared to Nvidia GPUs, AWS claims its chips offer 30–40% better cost-efficiency on common AI tasks. This is especially important for cloud clients operating at scale, where even marginal improvements translate into significant savings. ... Meanwhile, anticipation is building for Trainium3, the next-generation chip expected to double performance over its predecessor while reducing energy consumption by 50%."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-18
*   **Source:** AWS Chips Away at Nvidia's Lead with Rising Demand for Custom AI Processors
*   **Impact:** Medium. This is a public, consensus-leaning statement from AWS. While it presents a competitive threat to NVIDIA in the long term, the "non-consensus" aspect from the internal leak (Finding 1 & 2) suggests these claims are not yet translating into significant market share shift *away* from NVIDIA for large customers. However, it's important to acknowledge AWS's stated goals and progress.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. AWS has been publicly promoting its custom silicon for a while.

**Finding 4: Strong Demand for Trainium, Supply Struggling to Keep Up (Public Statement)**
*   **Snippet:** "In recent months, AWS has reported strong momentum for its internally developed Trainium chips, designed specifically for machine learning training. The demand has grown so rapidly that supply is struggling to keep up."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-18
*   **Source:** AWS Chips Away at Nvidia's Lead with Rising Demand for Custom AI Processors
*   **Impact:** Medium. This is a public statement from AWS, suggesting success. However, when juxtaposed with the internal leak about low *adoption rates among largest customers*, it raises questions about *who* is demanding these chips and at what scale, or if the "demand" is primarily internal to Amazon's own services (like Anthropic, which Amazon invested in and requires to use AWS chips). If supply is struggling, it could mean either genuine external demand or internal consumption. If it's internal, it still means less NVIDIA purchases from Amazon.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known (from AWS's perspective). The nuance of *who* is demanding them and the *scale* relative to NVIDIA is the non-consensus aspect when considering the internal leak.

**Finding 5: NVIDIA's Enduring Dominance and CUDA Moat**
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has dominated market share due to a combination of its more powerful processors and its proprietary programming language, CUDA. Developers switching to Trainium from Nvidia might have to redo software coding and ensure AI models still produce similar results on the new chips."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-18
*   **Source:** Amazon's custom AI chips success might lead to greater market share: report
*   **Impact:** Medium. This reiterates a well-known competitive advantage for NVIDIA. While not "non-consensus" in itself, it provides context for why Amazon's chips face adoption challenges, reinforcing the findings from the internal leak. The difficulty of switching from CUDA is a significant barrier.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known.

I will prioritize the first two findings as they represent the most material, non-consensus information from internal leaks. The other findings provide important context and highlight the ongoing competitive landscape. I will ensure to clearly state the contradictions.

Let's refine the output format.As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), my objective is to identify material, non-consensus information regarding Amazon's (AWS) custom AI chip progress that could impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. NVIDIA is reporting earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025. My research focused on web content published within the last three months.

While Amazon Web Services (AWS) has publicly touted the progress and demand for its custom AI chips (Trainium, Inferentia, and Graviton), recent internal leaks suggest a more challenging reality regarding their adoption among large cloud customers. This contradiction presents a key non-consensus insight that could be material for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings.

**Key Findings:**

Here are the key findings, ranked by their material impact on NVIDIA's upcoming earnings:

---

**Finding 1: Low Adoption Rates of AWS Custom AI Chips Among Largest Customers (Internal Leak)**

*   **Snippet:** "Amazon is struggling to compete with Nvidia's dominant AI chips, with low usage, "compatibility gaps," and project-migration issues putting millions of dollars in cloud revenue at risk, according to confidential internal documents and people familiar with the situation. ... Last year, the adoption rate of Trainium chips among AWS's largest customers was just 0.5% that of Nvidia's GPUs, according to one of the internal documents. This assessment, which measures usage levels of different AI chips through AWS's cloud service, was prepared in April. Inferentia, an AWS chip designed for a type of AI task known as inference, was only slightly better, at 2.7% of the Nvidia usage rate."
*   **Date:** 2024-05-28 (Internal document assessment prepared in April 2025)
*   **Source:** Entrepreneur, "Inside Amazon's Struggle to Crack Nvidia's AI-Chip Dominance" (via Business Insider)
*   **Impact:** High. This is highly material non-consensus information. If Amazon's largest cloud customers are showing extremely low adoption rates for Trainium and Inferentia chips (0.5% and 2.7% respectively compared to NVIDIA GPUs as of April 2025), it indicates that a significant portion of AWS's AI workloads, particularly from its key clients, continues to rely on NVIDIA's hardware. This directly contradicts the narrative of rapid displacement and suggests sustained, if not growing, demand for NVIDIA GPUs from a major hyperscaler. This could lead to a positive surprise in NVIDIA's data center revenue or provide a more robust outlook than anticipated if the market is overestimating AWS's internal chip success.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Public statements from Amazon executives have been more optimistic, making this internal leak a significant non-consensus data point.

**Finding 2: Contradiction Between Internal Struggles and Public Optimism from Amazon**

*   **Snippet:** "Early attempts from customers have exposed friction points and stifled adoption," the document said. This contradicts the more upbeat outlook Amazon executives have shared about AWS's AI-chip efforts. In an April earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said demand for AWS's custom silicon was "quite high," and his annual shareholder letter this year name-checked a number of early customers, such as Snap, Airbnb, and Anthropic."
*   **Date:** 2024-05-28
*   **Source:** Entrepreneur, "Inside Amazon's Struggle to Crack Nvidia's AI-Chip Dominance" (via Business Insider)
*   **Impact:** High. This finding reinforces the non-consensus nature of the low adoption rates. The direct contradiction between internal assessments and public pronouncements from Amazon's leadership suggests that the market may be operating on an overly optimistic view of AWS's custom chip capabilities and their ability to quickly reduce reliance on NVIDIA. For NVIDIA, this implies that the competitive threat from AWS's custom silicon might be less immediate and impactful than publicly perceived, potentially leading to stronger-than-expected demand from AWS.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market typically reacts to public statements from company executives. This leak provides a critical counter-narrative.

**Finding 3: AWS Claims of Cost-Efficiency and Performance for Trainium/Graviton**

*   **Snippet:** "Compared to Nvidia GPUs, AWS claims its chips offer 30–40% better cost-efficiency on common AI tasks. This is especially important for cloud clients operating at scale, where even marginal improvements translate into significant savings. ... Meanwhile, anticipation is building for Trainium3, the next-generation chip expected to double performance over its predecessor while reducing energy consumption by 50%."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-18
*   **Source:** AWS Chips Away at Nvidia's Lead with Rising Demand for Custom AI Processors
*   **Impact:** Medium. While this is a public statement from AWS and not "non-consensus" in its direct reporting, it represents Amazon's long-term strategic goal and competitive positioning. The claims of significant cost-efficiency and upcoming performance improvements (Trainium3 doubling performance and 50% less energy) highlight the ongoing competitive pressure NVIDIA faces. However, when viewed through the lens of the internal leaks (Findings 1 & 2), the *realized* impact on NVIDIA's near-term earnings might be mitigated by the adoption challenges. This information is important for understanding the long-term competitive landscape but less immediately impactful for the upcoming earnings given the adoption hurdles.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. AWS has consistently promoted these advantages.

**Finding 4: Reported Strong Demand for Trainium, Supply Struggling to Keep Up (Public Statement)**

*   **Snippet:** "In recent months, AWS has reported strong momentum for its internally developed Trainium chips, designed specifically for machine learning training. The demand has grown so rapidly that supply is struggling to keep up."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-18
*   **Source:** AWS Chips Away at Nvidia's Lead with Rising Demand for Custom AI Processors
*   **Impact:** Medium. This public statement from AWS suggests a positive trajectory for their custom chips. If demand is truly outpacing supply, it could indicate a successful ramp-up. However, the internal leaks (Finding 1 & 2) introduce ambiguity: is this demand primarily internal (e.g., from Amazon-backed Anthropic, which is required to use AWS chips) or from a broader base of large external customers? If it's largely internal, it still represents a shift away from NVIDIA for those specific workloads. If it's external, it could eventually impact NVIDIA. The "struggling to keep up" aspect could also imply that even with demand, AWS's ability to scale quickly enough to significantly dent NVIDIA's market share in the immediate term is limited.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known (from AWS's perspective). The *source* and *scale* of this demand, particularly in light of the internal leaks, are the non-consensus elements.

**Finding 5: NVIDIA's Enduring Dominance and CUDA Ecosystem as a Barrier**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has dominated market share due to a combination of its more powerful processors and its proprietary programming language, CUDA. Developers switching to Trainium from Nvidia might have to redo software coding and ensure AI models still produce similar results on the new chips."
*   **Date:** 2025-06-18
*   **Source:** Amazon's custom AI chips success might lead to greater market share: report
*   **Impact:** Medium. This reiterates a well-established competitive moat for NVIDIA. The difficulty and cost associated with migrating from NVIDIA's CUDA platform to alternative architectures like Trainium are significant barriers to adoption, even if AWS chips offer cost-performance advantages. This finding provides crucial context for why Amazon's internal chips are facing "compatibility gaps" and "project-migration issues" as highlighted in the leaked documents. It suggests that even with Amazon's efforts, NVIDIA's ecosystem lock-in remains a powerful force, supporting continued demand for NVIDIA's products.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This is a fundamental aspect of NVIDIA's market dominance.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

The most significant contradiction lies between Amazon's public statements regarding "quite high" demand for its custom silicon and the leaked internal documents revealing "low usage," "compatibility gaps," and very low adoption rates (0.5% for Trainium, 2.7% for Inferentia) among its largest customers compared to NVIDIA GPUs as of April 2025.

A key gap in the information is the precise breakdown of AWS's internal chip usage versus external customer adoption, and the specific types of workloads being shifted. While Amazon has invested in Anthropic and requires them to use AWS chips, the overall impact on NVIDIA's revenue from AWS remains somewhat opaque. The more recent articles (June, August 2025) generally present a more optimistic view of AWS's custom chip progress, but they do not directly refute or address the specific figures from the May 2025 internal leak.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is reporting Q2 FY2026 earnings today, and the market is keenly watching for any signs of competitive pressure, particularly from hyperscalers developing their own AI chips. While Amazon (AWS) has been a vocal proponent of its custom silicon strategy, aiming to reduce its reliance on NVIDIA, recent internal leaks paint a more nuanced picture.

Confidential documents from April 2025, reported in late May, indicate that AWS is struggling to gain significant traction for its Trainium and Inferentia AI chips among its largest cloud customers. Adoption rates were reported to be as low as 0.5% for Trainium and 2.7% for Inferentia compared to NVIDIA GPUs. This directly contradicts Amazon's public statements about "high demand" for its custom silicon. This suggests that despite Amazon's strategic intent and investments, the practical challenges of migrating from NVIDIA's established CUDA ecosystem and addressing "compatibility gaps" are proving substantial.

For NVIDIA, this non-consensus information is highly material. It implies that a significant portion of AWS's AI infrastructure, especially for its most demanding clients, continues to rely on NVIDIA's GPUs. This could translate into stronger-than-anticipated demand from AWS for NVIDIA's products in the near term, potentially bolstering NVIDIA's data center revenue and providing a more optimistic forward-looking guidance than if AWS's custom chips were rapidly gaining market share. While AWS continues to promote the cost-efficiency and performance benefits of its chips, and even reports struggling to keep up with demand, the internal adoption figures suggest that the competitive threat to NVIDIA's core business from AWS's custom silicon is not as immediate or widespread as some might believe. NVIDIA's strong ecosystem, particularly its CUDA software platform, continues to act as a significant barrier to entry for competitors.
