## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis for NVIDIA (NVDA) focusing on material, non-consensus information regarding TSMC's CoWoS packaging capacity, filtered for content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report for Q2 FY2026 (ending July 2025) will be heavily scrutinized for insights into the supply of its high-demand AI GPUs, particularly the impact of TSMC's CoWoS advanced packaging. Recent information from TSMC's Q2 2025 earnings call and various industry reports indicates a complex and nuanced picture of CoWoS capacity.

While TSMC continues its aggressive expansion plans, aiming to significantly increase CoWoS capacity by 2025 and 2026, the bottleneck is far from fully resolved. TSMC's management explicitly stated in their July 2025 earnings call that they are still "trying to narrow the gap" between CoWoS demand and supply. This suggests that despite increased output, the insatiable demand for AI chips, largely driven by NVIDIA, continues to outpace the available advanced packaging.

A notable, potentially non-consensus, development is TSMC's downward adjustment of its 2025 CoWoS capacity target from an initial 702,000 wafers to 625,000 wafers. This revision is attributed to "downward revisions in forecasts from several major customers." While NVIDIA's overall CoWoS allocation is still projected to increase significantly into 2026, this near-term adjustment could signal a slight moderation in some customer demands or a re-prioritization of specific CoWoS types. Crucially, NVIDIA is shifting its focus from CoWoS-S to the newer CoWoS-L technology for its Blackwell chips, a move that NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang clarified as an "expansion into CoWoS-L" rather than a reduction in overall capacity. This transition might introduce complexities or temporary shifts in capacity utilization.

NVIDIA remains the dominant force in CoWoS demand, expected to command over 60% of TSMC's expanded capacity. This strong allocation ensures NVIDIA's priority access but also highlights the continued reliance on TSMC and the persistent nature of the packaging bottleneck for the broader industry. The ramp-up of NVIDIA's H200 GPUs in Q2 2025 and the Blackwell platform in Q3 and Q4 2025 will further test TSMC's ability to meet demand.

Finally, TSMC's Q3 2025 guidance included a projected decrease in gross margins due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and "more pronounced dilution from overseas fabs." While not directly a CoWoS capacity issue, this could impact TSMC's overall profitability and potentially influence future pricing or investment strategies, indirectly affecting NVIDIA.

In summary, while CoWoS capacity is expanding, it remains a tight constraint. The downward revision of TSMC's 2025 capacity target and the ongoing "gap" between supply and demand are material non-consensus points that could influence NVIDIA's near-term guidance or commentary on supply chain health. The shift to CoWoS-L is a strategic move by NVIDIA but its immediate impact on overall available capacity for current-generation products needs careful consideration.

**Structured Findings:**

**1. Snippet:** "As you may already know, TSMC's CoWoS is the choke point for AI capacity, a topic discussed during the last Q&A, when management confirmed they are trying to narrow the gap in packaging with the current levels of demand: And so the megatrend for AI continues to be strong, and so is the CoWoS. And so now we are—again, we are in a mode trying to narrow the gap."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct statement from TSMC management in their most recent earnings call, confirming that CoWoS remains a bottleneck despite ongoing expansion efforts. This directly impacts NVIDIA's ability to ship more units.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that CoWoS is a bottleneck, but the explicit confirmation of "trying to narrow the gap" *this quarter* (Q2 2025 call, discussing Q3 outlook) suggests the easing is not as rapid as some might hope, making it slightly non-consensus in its persistence.

**2. Snippet:** "At the beginning of this year, TSMC initially planned to expand its CoWoS capacity from 305k wafers in 2024 to 702k wafers in 2025. However, due to downward revisions in forecasts from several major customers, TSMC has now adjusted its 2025 CoWoS capacity target from the original 702k wafers down to 625k wafers. Meanwhile, the monthly CoWoS capacity is set to expand from 36 kwpm in Q4 2024 to 65kwpm in Q4 2025. The specific CoWoS wafer capacity reductions of major customers are as follows: ... NVIDIA initially secured approximately ~450k CoWoS capacity at TSMC, including around 60k for CoWoS-S and 390k for CoWoS-L. However, due to a significant reduction in the production target of its B300A chip using CoWoS-S, NVIDIA's revised CoWoS capacity at TSMC for 2025 has been lowered to 397k wafers, with only 10k allocated to CoWoS-S and 387k to CoWoS-L."
*   **Date:** March 2, 2025 (While the article is from March, it discusses 2025 targets and revisions that would be relevant to the current quarter and forward guidance. It's a key data point on capacity adjustments.)

*   **Impact:** High. A downward revision in TSMC's *overall* 2025 CoWoS capacity target, even if still an expansion, is a material non-consensus point. The specific reduction in NVIDIA's CoWoS-S allocation for the B300A, offset by CoWoS-L, highlights a shift in product mix and potential short-term adjustments.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Most reports focus on the *expansion* of CoWoS capacity. A *downward revision* of the target, even with continued growth, is a non-consensus detail that could temper expectations for the pace of bottleneck easing.

**3. Snippet:** "Advanced packaging capacity for CoWoS at Taiwan Semiconductor is limited, even with output expected to roughly double in 2025 and expand again in 2026. Industry reports indicate that Nvidia has secured the majority of that allocation, leaving rivals with less room to ship at scale."

*   **Impact:** High. This reiterates the persistent nature of the CoWoS bottleneck despite expansion and confirms NVIDIA's dominant share, which is crucial for its competitive advantage but also means any TSMC capacity issues disproportionately affect NVIDIA's ability to meet demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that NVIDIA has priority, but the emphasis on "limited" capacity *even with doubling* highlights the ongoing challenge, which might be downplayed in some bullish narratives.

**4. Snippet:** "Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently made headlines by announcing that the company's most advanced AI chip, Blackwell, will transition from CoWoS-S to CoWoS-L advanced packaging technology. ... Huang emphasized that Nvidia's Blackwell chips are in high demand, and packaging constraints remain the primary bottleneck. He also noted that the increase in advanced packaging capacity over the last two years has been substantial. ... “As we move into Blackwell, we will predominantly use CoWoS-L. Of course, we're still manufacturing Hopper, which will continue to use CoWoS-S. We'll also be transitioning CoWoS-S capacity to CoWoS-L,” Huang explained... “It's not about reducing capacity; it's about expanding capacity into CoWoS-L.”"
*   **Date:** January 21, 2025 (While the article is from January, it quotes Jensen Huang's recent statements that are highly relevant to the current Blackwell ramp and CoWoS strategy, which is ongoing in Q2/Q3 2025).

*   **Impact:** Medium-High. This clarifies NVIDIA's strategic shift to CoWoS-L for Blackwell. While Huang states it's an expansion, any transition can have short-term implications for capacity utilization and yield rates as new processes scale. It confirms that packaging remains the primary bottleneck for Blackwell.
*   **Consensus Check:** The shift to CoWoS-L is becoming more known, but Huang's explicit clarification that it's an *expansion* and not a *reduction* of overall capacity, while still acknowledging packaging as the primary bottleneck, provides a nuanced perspective that might be overlooked.

**5. Snippet:** "TSMC's lower multiples are not a sign of undervaluation but rather a reflection of its stable, asset-heavy business model. Its gross margin of 58.6% in Q2 2025 underscores its pricing power and operational efficiency, while its $42 billion 2025 capex plan—focused on 3nm and 2nm node development—positions it to capture AI-driven demand without sacrificing profitability. NVIDIA, meanwhile, trades at a premium because its earnings growth (69% year-over-year in 2025) is tied to the volatile AI market and regulatory risks, such as U.S. export restrictions to China."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While not directly about CoWoS bottlenecks easing, this snippet from the current date highlights TSMC's strong financial position and continued investment in advanced nodes and packaging. This underpins the long-term capacity expansion, which is positive for NVIDIA, but also suggests TSMC's pricing power.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is likely consensus regarding TSMC's overall financial health and investment, but it provides a fresh, current-day perspective on the broader context of TSMC's ability to support NVIDIA's growth.

**6. Snippet:** "Management guided Q3 gross margins down by 210 bps due to the dilution effect of the fab expansion plans. We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decrease by 210 basis points to 56.5% at the midpoint, primarily due to the continued unfavorable foreign exchange rate and more pronounced dilution from overseas fabs as we ramp up further in Kumamoto and Arizona. What I found a bit disappointing is the fact that these pressures will persist, likely for the next 5 years."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025 (referencing TSMC Q2 2025 earnings call on July 17, 2025)
*   **Source:** Taiwan Semiconductor: Ultra Bullish On Nvidia's (Likely) B30/B30A To China, Seeking Alpha, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGQMk5hWmpYjvhqLaPk6trpoYyJW7tFtkdU8i1wtEhKFBFQ4aAtMikg0MmoLIO2GRTmAO3i5of4BWjnGQpU0SSu7jSHOi8M8SzBviRvStdOJGKmINnApiU37a6netE36zAKSnfNC3oDNV8VYpjn2jXit_GeNQHCC6SJ9IRSZ7NQo0YPnPClVAzZbxhABIDq4MCInW4NZTBIIHBTfQAEjd73hIVd8fZJ1gc=
*   **Impact:** Medium. This is a direct financial guidance from TSMC that could indirectly affect NVIDIA. While not a CoWoS capacity constraint, margin dilution for TSMC could lead to increased pricing for advanced packaging services in the future, impacting NVIDIA's cost of goods sold.
*   **Consensus Check:** This specific Q3 margin guidance and the long-term outlook on dilution from overseas fabs might be overlooked by investors primarily focused on capacity numbers.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction/Nuance:** The overall narrative of "TSMC doubling CoWoS capacity" (e.g.,) is nuanced by the "downward revision" of the 2025 capacity target. This isn't a direct contradiction of *expansion*, but rather a recalibration of the *pace* or *magnitude* of that expansion for 2025, driven by customer forecast adjustments. This suggests that while capacity is growing, the path to equilibrium might be less smooth than a simple "doubling" implies.
*   **Gap:** While TSMC management confirmed they are "trying to narrow the gap", the earnings call summaries provided do not contain a direct, explicit statement from TSMC on whether CoWoS bottlenecks are *easing* or becoming *tighter* specifically for Q2/Q3 2025 beyond the general "narrowing the gap" comment. The downward revision for 2025 capacity suggests some easing of *demand* from certain customers, but the overall sentiment from other sources (e.g.,) is that the bottleneck persists. More granular detail on current quarter CoWoS utilization and specific customer demand trends would be beneficial.
