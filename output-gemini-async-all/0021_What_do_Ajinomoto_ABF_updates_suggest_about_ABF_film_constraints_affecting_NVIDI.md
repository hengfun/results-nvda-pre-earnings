## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, a deep dive into the Ajinomoto Build-up Film (ABF) supply chain reveals persistent constraints that could materially impact the company's package output timing and forward-looking guidance. Despite Ajinomoto's ongoing capacity expansion efforts, recent industry reports suggest that demand for advanced ABF substrates, critical for high-performance GPUs, continues to outpace supply gains, leading to sustained bottlenecks in advanced packaging.

Ajinomoto, holding over 95% of the global market share for ABF film used in GPU and CPU substrates, remains a singular and crucial choke-point in the semiconductor supply chain. While the company has invested significantly to boost production, the full alleviation of these constraints appears to be a longer-term prospect, with immediate challenges persisting through 2025.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Lagging Output Gains Despite 2025 Expansions:** Despite suppliers expanding ABF mixing rooms in 2025, output gains have reportedly lagged behind the surging demand. This indicates that even with increased capacity, the market remains tight, reinforcing the leverage of ABF suppliers.
*   **ABF as a Persistent 2025 Bottleneck:** In 2025, substrate materials, particularly ABF due to Ajinomoto's near-monopoly, continue to be identified as a "choke-point" and "bottleneck" in advanced chip packaging. This directly impacts the ability of companies like NVIDIA to get their high-performance chips to market.
*   **NVIDIA's Packaging Bottlenecks:** NVIDIA, along with AMD, has fully booked TSMC's advanced packaging capacity (CoWoS) for 2024 and 2025. By late 2024, NVIDIA was reportedly selling its newest "Blackwell" AI chips as fast as TSMC could assemble them, with packaging remaining "a bottleneck due to capacity constraints." Given ABF's integral role in CoWoS and other advanced packaging, this directly implicates ABF supply.
*   **Long-Term Capacity Expansion, Short-Term Strain:** Ajinomoto has committed to investing JPY 25 billion (approximately USD 166 million) to expand its ABF production capacity by 50% by 2030. While this signals a long-term commitment to meeting demand, the "by 2030" timeframe suggests that the immediate impact on current supply constraints for Q2 FY2026 may be limited.
*   **Systemic Supply Chain Challenges:** The ABF market continues to grapple with logistics disruptions and raw material shortages, which have affected approximately 27% of OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) and substrate suppliers. These systemic issues contribute to hindering capacity expansion and delaying lead times, particularly during periods of high demand.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "ABF represented 61% of the advanced IC substrates market size in 2024. Ajinomoto's exclusive resin recipe established consistent dielectric performance and drillability that customers trusted for 2.5D and 3D stacks. Suppliers expanded ABF mixing rooms in 2025, but output gains lagged demand growth, reinforcing seller leverage."

    *   **Source:** Advanced IC Substrates Market Size, Growth, Forecast & Global Report 2030, Mordor Intelligence
    *   **Impact:** High. This snippet directly indicates that despite capacity expansions by suppliers in 2025, the growth in ABF output has not kept pace with demand, suggesting ongoing supply tightness relevant to NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general demand for ABF is known, the specific detail that "output gains lagged demand growth" in 2025, even with expansions, provides a more nuanced and potentially underappreciated view of the current supply situation.

*   **Snippet:** "Even as the great chip crunch of 2020–2022 fades, the semiconductor supply chain in 2025 is grappling with new choke-points. Advanced chip packaging, photomask production, and substrate materials have emerged as bottlenecks, keeping critical tech products in short supply... ABF substrate monopoly: A key issue is material concentration. ABF, the critical dielectric film in high-density substrates, is almost entirely controlled by one company — Ajinomoto of Japan. Remarkably, Ajinomoto holds over 95% of the global market share for ABF film used in GPU and CPU substrates."

    *   **Impact:** High. This confirms that in 2025, ABF substrate materials remain a "choke-point" for advanced chip packaging, directly impacting high-performance chips like NVIDIA's GPUs due to Ajinomoto's dominant market position.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. The general awareness of supply chain issues exists, but the explicit and continued designation of ABF as a *current* bottleneck in 2025, despite previous reports of easing, may be overlooked.

*   **Snippet:** "In mid-2024, TSMC revealed that its advanced packaging capacity for 2024 and 2025 was fully booked by just two clients — Nvidia and AMD — racing to secure capacity for AI processors. CoWoS capacity demand had tripled year-on-year by late 2023, catching even suppliers off guard. As a result, chip makers began to face queues at the packaging stage: by late 2024, Nvidia was reportedly selling its newest “Blackwell” AI chips as fast as TSMC could assemble them, with packaging remaining “a bottleneck due to capacity constraints” (Nvidia CEO says its advanced packaging technology needs are changing | Reuters)."

    *   **Source:** How the Chip Shortage Never Really Ended | by elongated_musk - Medium
    *   **Impact:** High. This directly links NVIDIA to ongoing packaging bottlenecks for its Blackwell AI chips in late 2024 and into 2025, which is highly relevant given ABF's critical role in advanced packaging technologies like CoWoS.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While NVIDIA's high demand for TSMC's CoWoS is known, the explicit statement that packaging remains a "bottleneck due to capacity constraints" for their newest chips *into 2025* could be underappreciated.

*   **Snippet:** "Ajinomoto Co., Inc. responded by investing 25 billion yen to expand its Gunma and Kawasaki factories to boost ABF capacity by 50% by 2030. The firm also introduced a next-generation build-up film substrate with improved heat performance and reduced dielectric loss to meet emerging needs for high-speed data transmission and miniaturization."

    *   **Source:** Ajinomoto Build-up Film (ABF) Market Size, Share & Analysis 2033 Report
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This highlights Ajinomoto's long-term strategy for capacity expansion and technological advancement, which is positive for future supply. However, the "by 2030" timeline suggests that the full benefit of this 50% boost is not immediate, implying continued near-term constraints.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. Ajinomoto's capacity expansion plans have been reported, and the long-term nature of the full capacity increase is likely understood.

*   **Snippet:** "The ABF (Ajinomoto Build-up Film) market struggles with logistics disruptions and raw material shortages, which have impacted roughly 27% of OSAT and substrate suppliers. Additionally, small- and mid-sized companies face high barriers to entry due to the specialized cleanroom environments and advanced equipment required for ABF film fabrication. These structural restraints hinder capacity expansion and delay lead times, especially during global semiconductor supply chain crises."
    *   **Date:** 2025-08-11
    *   **Source:** ABF (Ajinomoto Build-up Film) Market Report | Forecast - Global Growth Insights
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This points to broader, systemic issues within the ABF supply chain, such as logistics and raw material shortages, that continue to "hinder capacity expansion and delay lead times" for suppliers as of August 2025. These factors could indirectly affect NVIDIA's ability to secure sufficient packaged chips.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general supply chain issues are recognized, the specific impact of logistics and raw material shortages *on ABF production* and its effect on *delaying lead times* for OSAT and substrate suppliers in the current period might be less widely understood.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

There is no direct, specific data quantifying how much ABF film Ajinomoto is currently supplying to NVIDIA or the precise impact of Ajinomoto's *recent* (Q2 FY2026 relevant) capacity additions on NVIDIA's specific package output. While NVIDIA is clearly impacted by overall packaging bottlenecks, the exact contribution of ABF film constraints versus other packaging components (e.g., HBM, CoWoS assembly capacity) is not disaggregated in the available information. The "leadership shift" at Ajinomoto in 2025 is mentioned, but its immediate implications for supply strategy or NVIDIA's access to ABF are not detailed.
