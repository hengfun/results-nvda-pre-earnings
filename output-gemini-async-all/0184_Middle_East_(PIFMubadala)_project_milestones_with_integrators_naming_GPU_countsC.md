## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have identified several material, non-consensus data points regarding Middle Eastern AI infrastructure projects that could impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The information, published within the last three months, highlights significant GPU deployments, integrator involvement, and operational timelines.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's strategic positioning in the Middle East's burgeoning AI market continues to solidify, with substantial commitments from sovereign wealth funds like Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and UAE's Mubadala. The PIF-backed entity, HUMAIN, is spearheading a massive AI infrastructure build-out, with an initial deployment of 18,000 NVIDIA GB300 Grace Blackwell supercomputers expected to be operational by 2026. This initial phase is part of a broader plan to acquire "hundreds of thousands" of NVIDIA GPUs over five years, powering up to 500 megawatts of AI computing capacity. Cisco has been named as a key integrator for HUMAIN, providing critical networking and security technologies.

In the UAE, the Mubadala-backed G42, through its MGX fund, is making significant global AI investments, including a 5GW AI data center campus in the UAE (Stargate UAE) with its first 200 MW phase anticipated by 2026. G42 is also aggressively expanding its GPU access in Europe, reportedly close to securing nearly half of Northern Data's 23,000 NVIDIA GPUs. Meanwhile, Qatar's Ooredoo has already launched sovereign AI cloud services utilizing NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, indicating ongoing revenue recognition from this region. A new, notable development is a consortium involving NAVER and NVIDIA planning a 40-megawatt AI supercomputing infrastructure in Morocco, equipped with Blackwell (GB200) GPUs, with the first phase starting in Q4 2025 and operational by year-end.

The consistent theme across these projects is the strong emphasis on "sovereign AI," where nations are investing heavily in domestic AI infrastructure to ensure data control and reduce reliance on foreign providers. This trend creates a robust, long-term demand channel for NVIDIA's high-end GPUs and its full-stack AI ecosystem. The specific GPU counts, integrator names, and near-term operational targets for initial phases (Q4 2025/2026) provide concrete data points that may not be fully reflected in current consensus estimates, suggesting potential upside for NVIDIA's guidance. The deployment of Blackwell GPUs in Morocco by year-end 2025, ahead of some larger projects, could also contribute to earlier revenue recognition for NVIDIA's latest architecture.

*   **Impact:** High. This is a new, specific project in the broader EMEA region with a very near-term deployment target for NVIDIA's latest Blackwell (GB200) GPUs. The "by the end of the year" (2025) timeline suggests revenue recognition could occur sooner than for some larger, longer-term projects, potentially providing a positive surprise for NVIDIA's forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Low. This project, with its specific GPU type and aggressive timeline, is likely non-consensus and could be a significant positive for NVIDIA's near-term Blackwell ramp.

### **Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Precise Revenue Recognition Timing:** While operational dates are provided, the exact timing of NVIDIA's revenue recognition for these large, multi-phase projects within specific fiscal quarters is not explicitly detailed. This remains a key variable for short-term earnings impact.
*   **Full GPU Counts for All Projects:** For some initiatives, power capacity is mentioned (e.g., 5GW for Stargate UAE), but the precise NVIDIA GPU count for the entire project (beyond initial phases) is not always quantified, making it challenging to fully model the long-term revenue potential.
*   **Blackwell vs. Hopper Mix:** While Blackwell is clearly ramping, the exact mix of Blackwell and Hopper GPUs in current and near-term Middle Eastern deployments is not consistently specified. This could influence average selling prices (ASPs) and overall revenue.
*   **Integrator Scope:** While Cisco is identified for some projects, the full ecosystem of integrators and their specific contributions across all Middle Eastern NVIDIA deployments is not exhaustively detailed.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** While the focus is heavily on NVIDIA, one older snippet mentioned G42 as a Cerebras customer in 2023. The current competitive landscape for non-NVIDIA AI hardware in the region, if any, is not clearly delineated in the recent search results.
