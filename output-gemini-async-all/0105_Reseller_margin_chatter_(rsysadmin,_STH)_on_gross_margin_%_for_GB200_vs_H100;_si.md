## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information regarding NVIDIA's (NVDA) reseller margins for GB200 vs. H100, likely to impact its Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is navigating a complex transition from its Hopper (H100) to Blackwell (GB200) architecture, with several factors influencing gross margins. While NVIDIA's official guidance points to a modest sequential improvement in gross margins for Q2 FY2026 (71.8%-72% non-GAAP) driven by Blackwell profitability, underlying dynamics suggest potential nuances that may not be fully priced into consensus estimates.

One key non-consensus insight is the initial production hurdles and subsequent ramp-up of GB200 systems. Reports indicate that shipments of GB200 were delayed due to technical issues like overheating, liquid cooling leaks, and inter-chip connectivity problems, which suppliers reportedly resolved by late Q1 2025, leading to a rapid scaling of production. This suggests that while Q2 revenue might have been impacted by earlier delays, the accelerated ramp-up could set the stage for stronger performance in the latter half of the year, potentially influencing forward guidance more than the immediate Q2 results.

The pricing and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) comparison between GB200 and H100 also presents a dynamic picture. While GB200 NVL72 racks are significantly more expensive than H100 servers (e.g., $3.1M-$3.9M for a GB200 NVL72 rack versus $190K-$250K for an H100 server), the performance-per-TCO advantage for GB200 was not initially clear. However, software optimizations have reportedly improved GB200's performance per TCO to 1.5x that of H100 by July 2025, with expectations of reaching 2.7x by year-end. This evolving value proposition could influence customer adoption rates and NVIDIA's ability to maintain premium pricing, impacting gross margins.

Furthermore, the increasing demand for Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) by hyperscalers aiming to lower their cost of ownership compared to NVIDIA's high-margin GPUs presents a long-term, non-consensus risk to NVIDIA's margin profile. While NVIDIA's current dominance allows for high margins, the strategic moves by major customers like OpenAI, which can arbitrage idle capacity and influence market pricing, could lead to margin compression in the future.

Contradictory pricing information for GB200 and H100 across different sources (per GPU vs. per rack) makes precise margin calculations challenging for external analysts. This gap in clear, consistent pricing data could lead to varied assumptions in financial models.

Overall, while NVIDIA's official stance is positive on Blackwell's margin contribution, the initial production challenges, the evolving TCO advantage, and the long-term competitive pressures from ASICs and large buyers are material, non-consensus factors that warrant close attention for their potential impact on both Q2 earnings and future guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

**Finding 1: Initial GB200 Production Delays and Subsequent Ramp-Up**
*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia suppliers building its Blackwell AI server racks have reportedly solved a series of technical hurdles, allowing them to accelerate production of the GB200 AI rack. According to the Financial Times, suppliers including Foxconn, Inventec, Dell, and Wistron have made 'a series of breakthroughs' to allow shipments to kick off. Shipments of the GB200 were delayed due to technical issues that emerged at the end of last year, disrupting production. Nvidia's Taiwanese partners announced at Computex 2025 that shipments of the GB200 racks had commenced at the end of Q1 2025, the FT wrote, stating that 'production capacity was now being rapidly scaled up.'"

*   **Impact:** High. Initial production delays could have constrained Q2 FY2026 revenue and potentially impacted gross margins if early production was less efficient. However, the "rapidly scaled up" production by late Q1 2025 suggests a strong ramp into Q2 and beyond, which could positively surprise on forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While some might have been aware of general ramp-up, specific details about initial technical hurdles and the timing of their resolution, and the subsequent rapid scaling, might not be fully incorporated into consensus models for Q2.

**Finding 2: Hyperscaler Demand for ASICs and OpenAI's Market Influence**
*   **Snippet:** "On the ASIC side, demand for ASICs is increasing, as hyperscalers want to lower the cost of ownership versus NVIDIA's high-margin GPUs."
*   **Snippet:** "As both a massive buyer and a seller, OpenAI can arbitrage idle capacity across time zones and workloads, and those forwards become a public price signal that narrows the bid ask gap across the market. As both a massive buyer and a seller, OpenAI can arbitrage idle capacity across time zones and workloads, so the cost per GPU hour drops and the posted price can drop with it, forcing others to compress gross margin."

*   **Impact:** Medium. The increasing demand for ASICs by hyperscalers signals a long-term potential for margin compression for NVIDIA's GPUs as customers seek lower-cost alternatives. OpenAI's ability to influence market pricing as both a buyer and seller could also put downward pressure on gross margins for NVIDIA's products in the future. This might not impact Q2 directly but could be a factor in forward guidance or investor sentiment.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the threat of ASICs is known, the direct link to hyperscalers actively seeking to lower cost of ownership *versus NVIDIA's high-margin GPUs* and the specific mechanism of OpenAI's market influence are less commonly discussed in mainstream analysis.

**Finding 3: Evolving Performance per TCO for GB200 vs. H100**
*   **Snippet:** "GB200 NVL72 first shipment started in mid-February this year. By May 2025, the GB200 NVL72's performance per TCO had not surpassed that of the H100; however, by July, Semianalysis began to see the performance per TCO reach 1.5x that of the H100, which is close to the target range. That improvement is driven by software optimizations on CUDA for GB200 NVL72. By the end of the year, Semianalysis expects the performance per TCO to reach a 2.7x that of H100, making the GB200 NVL72 a clear choice for model training."

*   **Impact:** Medium. The initial lack of a clear TCO advantage for GB200 in early Q2 could have slowed adoption or put pressure on pricing. However, the rapid improvement through software optimizations by July and strong future projections indicate that the value proposition is solidifying, which supports sustained pricing power and potentially expanding margins as the GB200 ramp continues. This dynamic evolution of TCO might not be fully appreciated.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While performance benchmarks are often discussed, the specific timeline of GB200's TCO advantage evolving through software optimizations and its potential impact on adoption and pricing power is a more nuanced, non-consensus detail.

**Finding 4: Discrepancies in GB200 and H100 Pricing Information**
*   **Snippet:** "An H100 server runs about $190K, and all-in with storage and networking a hyperscaler pays $250K per server, while a GB200 NVL72 rack lists around $3.1M for the rack unit and about $3.9M all-in per rack."
*   **Snippet:** "(partner of Nvidia), a GB200 rack is approximately $7m. I dont know what an H100 rack costs but when you're quoting H100 - you're only talking bout the GPU then you're stripping a ton of the costs out (networking, cpu's, raw materials, cooling components, there's literally thousands of parts you just tossed out)."
*   **Snippet:** "The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 costs approximately $60,000–$70,000, while the NVIDIA H100 costs around $30,000. The GB200 NVL72 is roughly 2-2.3 times more expensive than the H100."

*   **Impact:** Medium. The significant variation in reported prices for GB200 and H100 (ranging from per-GPU to full-rack systems) creates ambiguity for analysts trying to model NVIDIA's gross margins. Without a clear, consistent understanding of the average selling prices (ASPs) for comparable units, it's difficult to precisely gauge margin compression or expansion. This gap in transparent pricing data could lead to disparate analyst estimates.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While analysts use various methods to estimate ASPs, the direct contradiction and lack of clarity in publicly available pricing for comparable configurations (GPU vs. server vs. rack) is a non-consensus challenge that could lead to modeling errors.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Pricing Discrepancy:** There's a clear contradiction in the reported prices for GB200 and H100. Snippet quotes per-GPU prices ($60k-$70k for GB200 NVL72, $30k for H100), while snippets and provide much higher rack/server prices ($3.1M-$3.9M for GB200 NVL72 rack, $190K-$250K for H100 server, and a Reddit comment suggesting $7M for a GB200 rack). This highlights a critical gap in understanding the exact product configurations being priced and thus the true ASPs and potential gross margins.
*   **Direct Reseller Margin Data:** The search did not yield explicit "reseller margin chatter" with specific gross margin percentages for GB200 vs. H100 from forums like r/sysadmin or STH. The information is more inferential, based on pricing, TCO, and broader industry trends. This is a gap in the specific type of non-consensus data requested.
*   **Impact of H100 Re-contracting:** Snippet mentions "older clusters (A100/H100) are being re-contracted for 1–3 years, often serving inference." While this indicates continued demand, the margin profile of these re-contracted older systems compared to new GB200 sales is not clear, which could affect the overall blended gross margin.
