## Analysis

**Material, Non-Consensus Information for NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q2 FY2026 Earnings Report**

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report is poised to be significantly influenced by recent, and at times contradictory, developments concerning its ability to sell AI chips in the crucial Chinese market. While early August 2025 brought news of a deal allowing NVIDIA and AMD to resume exports of certain AI chips, including NVIDIA's H20, to China in exchange for a 15% revenue share with the US government, this positive momentum has been quickly challenged by actions from Beijing.

The most material and potentially non-consensus information indicates that the Chinese government has actively discouraged local companies from purchasing NVIDIA's H20 chips, particularly for government and national security-related projects. These warnings, reportedly citing potential security issues and promoting domestic alternatives, have led NVIDIA to reportedly halt production of its H20 chips as of August 22, 2025. This direct pushback from Beijing, despite US export approvals, could severely curtail NVIDIA's expected revenue from its China-specific H20 chips and represents a significant headwind for the upcoming earnings.

Further complicating the export landscape, a substantial backlog of US export license applications at the Department of Commerce was reported in early August. This systemic issue could delay the actual shipment and revenue recognition of any approved chip exports, adding another layer of uncertainty to NVIDIA's near-term China revenue.

Looking ahead, there are discussions about the Trump administration potentially allowing NVIDIA to sell a more advanced, yet still compliant, chip (B30A, a downgraded version of Blackwell) to China, also under a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the US government. While this offers a potential future revenue stream, the immediate impact of China's stance on H20 chips is likely to be more critical for the current earnings period. The rapid succession of conflicting signals from both the US and Chinese governments, culminating in the reported H20 production halt, creates considerable uncertainty around NVIDIA's China market performance.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1: US Government Deal for H20 Exports with Revenue Share**

*   **Snippet:** "August 11, 2025: NVIDIA, AMD strike deal with US government on AI chip exports to China. The US government has reached an agreement with NVIDIA and AMD to allow the companies to export certain AI chips to China in exchange for paying the government 15 percent of their China-related AI chip sales. In return, the US will issue the export licenses that have been withheld in recent months."
*   **Date:** August 11, 2025
*   **Source:** Vertex AI Search (citing various sources including Reuters, Financial Times, New York Times)
*   **Impact:** High. This initially appeared to be a significant positive development, potentially reopening a substantial market for NVIDIA's China-specific chips (like H20) after previous restrictions. However, subsequent developments have largely negated this positive impact for the immediate term.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This deal was reported by major financial news outlets and likely factored into initial analyst expectations for China revenue.

**Finding 2: Chinese Government Discouragement and NVIDIA H20 Production Halt**

*   **Snippet:** "On August 22, 2025, The Information reported that Nvidia ordered its suppliers to stop production on its H20 AI chips. This comes after Beijing reportedly warned Chinese companies to avoid the chips due to potential security issues that would provide the U.S. backdoor access to sensitive data, claims that Nvidia disputes. The Chinese government instead urges companies to use domestically designed and manufactured chips."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025
*   **Source:** Built In (citing The Information), Moneyweb (citing unnamed sources)
*   **Impact:** Very High. This is the most material non-consensus information. A reported halt in H20 production due to direct Chinese government pressure implies a severe reduction or complete loss of H20 sales in China, directly contradicting the earlier US export deal. This could significantly impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 revenue from China and its forward-looking guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Emerging. While reported, the full implications of this rapid and direct Chinese government intervention, especially the reported production halt, may not be fully priced into consensus earnings estimates, which might have been more optimistic following the US license approvals.

**Finding 3: US Export License Backlog**

*   **Snippet:** "(2025-08-02) Thousands of US export license applications are delayed due to internal disruptions at the Department of Commerce, sources told Reuters. The backlog affects companies exporting goods and technology globally, including to China. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), responsible for approvals, has not issued expected new rules and is dealing with staff departures and slowed communication with industry. High-profile shipments, like Nvidia's AI chips to China, are among those impacted, with billions of dollars in orders awaiting approval. A US official said this is the longest backlog in more than 30 years."
*   **Date:** August 2, 2025
*   **Source:** Tech in Asia (citing Reuters)
*   **Impact:** Medium. Even if licenses are granted, a significant backlog at the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) could delay the actual delivery of chips and subsequent revenue recognition. This introduces operational friction and uncertainty regarding the volume of chips NVIDIA can physically ship to China in the near term, regardless of market demand.
*   **Consensus Check:** Potentially overlooked. While the existence of a backlog might be generally known, its specific impact on NVIDIA's ability to fulfill orders and its potential to defer revenue might not be fully quantified in analyst models.

**Finding 4: Potential for More Advanced Chip Exports (B30A) with Revenue Share**

*   **Snippet:** "On August 19, 2025, The Information reported that Nvidia is reportedly developing a new AI chip for the Chinese market that is more powerful than its existing H20 GPU. The chip is said to be half as powerful as Nvidia's B300 Blackwell GPU, and is being designed to ensure it complies with U.S. government regulations while maintaining competitiveness in China's AI sector. Nvidia confirmed that it is evaluating product options with regulatory approval and emphasized the chip would be for “beneficial commercial use.” ... Two Cabinet members on Tuesday said President Donald Trump is open to granting Nvidia permission to sell a more technologically advanced chip to China. ... in exchange for a 15 percent cut of revenues for the U.S. government."
*   **Date:** August 19, 2025
*   **Source:** Built In (citing The Information), POLITICO Pro
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (forward-looking). This indicates a potential future revenue stream from a more powerful, China-compliant chip, which could be a long-term positive. However, the 15% revenue share with the US government would impact margins, and the recent Chinese government's stance on H20 chips (Finding 2) raises questions about the market acceptance of *any* US-designed chips, even if more advanced, in the current geopolitical climate.
*   **Consensus Check:** Emerging. The development of a new chip and the potential for its approval is likely known, but the specific details of its performance, the revenue-sharing agreement, and the broader context of Chinese government pushback might not be fully integrated into long-term financial models.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The most significant contradiction lies between the August 11, 2025, news of NVIDIA securing US government licenses to resume H20 sales to China and the August 22, 2025, report of NVIDIA halting H20 production due to Chinese government warnings against their use. This suggests a rapid and severe shift in the viability of the H20 market in China, despite initial US regulatory approval.
*   **Gap:** Despite the specific query for Chinese business media (Caixin, 21st Century, LatePost, Securities Times), the search results did not yield direct articles from these publications. The information regarding Chinese government actions is primarily reported by Western media, often citing unnamed sources or official statements. This limits the ability to fully understand the nuanced official and unofficial directives from Beijing, as well as the specific "volume" and "scope" of any such measures from a local perspective.
