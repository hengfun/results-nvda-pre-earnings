## Analysis

As a pre-earnings research analyst, the latest earnings call transcripts from major enterprise software companies like ServiceNow and SAP, along with Salesforce's most recent available transcript, reveal strong enterprise-wide adoption and investment in AI. While direct mentions of increased capital expenditure specifically on NVIDIA GPUs are limited, the pervasive integration of AI into core business offerings, significant data processing growth, and strategic partnerships with NVIDIA strongly indicate a robust and growing demand for underlying AI infrastructure. This suggests a continued tailwind for NVIDIA's data center business.

The information gathered, particularly the explicit partnership between ServiceNow and NVIDIA on the Nemotron large language model and Salesforce's exponential data growth directly linked to AI preparation, offers material insights into the demand side of the AI infrastructure market. These specific data points, especially the scale of data processing and direct vendor partnerships, may not be fully priced into the market, offering a non-consensus view on the sustained and deepening enterprise commitment to AI.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Finding 1: ServiceNow's Direct Partnership with NVIDIA and Tangible AI Deal Wins**

*   **Snippet:** "The partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA Quick Quote NVDA - Free Report) on the Nemotron large language model expands reasoning capabilities while allowing flexibility across multiple AI providers, including Microsoft's ( MSFT Quick Quote MSFT - Free Report) OpenAI, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. This breadth of support has translated into tangible wins, highlighted by a $20 million Now Assist deal and 21 agreements involving five or more Now Assist products."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, recent (within 10 days of NVIDIA's earnings) mention of a partnership with NVIDIA for a large language model (Nemotron) and specific, significant deal wins ($20 million Now Assist deal, 21 deals with 5+ Now Assist products). This clearly indicates that a major enterprise software vendor is leveraging NVIDIA's technology for its AI offerings, translating into tangible revenue for ServiceNow and, by extension, demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure.
*   **Consensus Check:** While ServiceNow's general AI focus is known, the specific details of the NVIDIA partnership on Nemotron and the concrete deal figures for AI products, especially so close to NVIDIA's earnings, could be overlooked by the broader market.

**Finding 2: Salesforce's Exponential Data Cloud Growth Driving AI Preparation**

*   **Snippet:** "We added more than 1,000 Data Cloud customers for the second quarter in a row. 8 trillion records were ingested in the Data Cloud in the quarter, up 42% year-over-year, and we processed 2 quadrillion records. That's a 217% increase compared to last year. Over 1 trillion activations drove customer engagement, which is a 33% increase year-over-year. This incredible growth of data in our system and the level of transactions that we're able to deliver not just in the core system but especially in data cloud is preparing our customers for this next generation of AI."

*   **Impact:** High. The staggering year-over-year increases in records ingested (42%) and processed (217%) in Salesforce's Data Cloud, explicitly linked to "preparing our customers for this next generation of AI," strongly implies a massive and growing demand for underlying compute and storage infrastructure capable of handling AI workloads. NVIDIA's GPUs are central to such processing.
*   **Consensus Check:** While Salesforce's AI initiatives are known, the sheer scale of data growth and processing, and its direct connection to AI preparation, might be underestimated by the market as a driver for AI infrastructure demand.

**Finding 3: ServiceNow's AI-Driven Operational Efficiencies and Product Adoption**

*   **Snippet:** "Operating Margin: 29.5% non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 2025, more than 2.5 percentage points above guidance, benefiting from AI-driven operational efficiencies and marketing spend timing." and "AI Product Momentum: NOW Assist net new ACV to date and Plus product attach rates both beat expectations in Q2 2025, with 21 deals involving five or more NOW Assist products."

*   **Impact:** Medium. While "AI-driven operational efficiencies" might imply cost savings, the strong "AI Product Momentum" and successful adoption of NOW Assist products demonstrate that enterprises are actively investing in and deploying AI solutions. This creates a demand pull for the underlying hardware that powers these AI applications, which frequently includes NVIDIA's GPUs.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general trend of AI product adoption is known, but the specific financial benefits (beating guidance due to AI efficiencies) combined with concrete deal numbers for AI products could highlight a stronger-than-anticipated enterprise commitment to AI deployment, indirectly benefiting NVIDIA.

**Finding 4: SAP's Broad "Business AI" Initiatives and Future Revenue Expectations**

*   **Snippet:** "Launched initiatives including Business AI, enhancing productivity and the customer experience across its offerings. Continuous innovation in AI agents and software solutions, integrating SAP's Business Data Cloud across various business functions." and "The ongoing development and integration of Business AI and SAP's Business Data Cloud promise significant future revenue streams and client engagement expansion."

*   **Impact:** Medium. SAP, a critical enterprise software provider, is making substantial investments in "Business AI" and expects it to drive "significant future revenue streams." This indicates a broad and deep commitment to AI adoption across its vast customer base, which will necessitate increased AI infrastructure. While not directly naming NVIDIA, it reinforces the strong secular trend of enterprise AI investment, benefiting providers of AI infrastructure.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general push for AI by large enterprise software companies is known, but the explicit expectation of "significant future revenue streams" from Business AI by a company like SAP underscores the long-term, material nature of this trend, which may not be fully appreciated in its implications for hardware providers.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   None of the reviewed transcripts explicitly detail a *direct increase in their own capital expenditure specifically for NVIDIA GPUs* due to AI. Their statements primarily focus on their AI product development, customer adoption, and internal efficiencies.
*   Salesforce's general capex guidance (slightly below 2% of revenue) does not indicate a *surge* in infrastructure spending, but the underlying data growth suggests that the existing capex might be increasingly allocated to AI-capable hardware.
*   The information is from the demand side (enterprise software companies), which indirectly drives demand for NVIDIA's supply-side infrastructure. There's no direct confirmation of specific NVIDIA orders from these companies within these transcripts.
