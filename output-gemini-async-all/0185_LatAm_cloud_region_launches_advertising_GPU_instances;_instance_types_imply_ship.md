## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information regarding NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report, filtered for content published within the last three months and focusing on Latin American cloud region GPU instances and implied shipments.

### Human-Readable Analysis

NVIDIA's presence and growth in Latin America appear to be a significant, albeit often less highlighted, driver for its data center segment. While direct announcements of "advertising GPU instances" in LatAm cloud regions within the last three months were not explicitly found, the broader trend of hyperscalers and local cloud providers expanding their AI infrastructure with NVIDIA GPUs strongly implies increased shipments. Advertising workloads, which heavily leverage AI/ML for targeting and processing, would naturally utilize these general-purpose AI GPUs.

A particularly impactful and very recent development is the Oracle-NVIDIA-Elea partnership for the "Rio AI City" project in Brazil, a massive data center cluster. This announcement, made today (August 27, 2025), signals substantial future demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs and software in the region, directly influencing forward-looking guidance.

Furthermore, recent reports indicate strong GPU deliveries in Latin America with no major delays, and a significant improvement in delivery times for NVIDIA's main processor families like Hopper, shrinking from up to a year to just a few months. This suggests a more efficient supply chain capable of meeting the escalating regional demand. KeyBanc Capital Markets also provided a non-consensus insight into NVIDIA's overall GPU supply growth, noting a 40% increase in the fiscal quarter ending July and an expected 20% increase by October, alongside improved production efficiency for GB200 racks. These factors collectively point to a robust supply and demand environment for NVIDIA's data center GPUs, with Latin America playing a growing role.

### Structured Findings

**Finding 1: Oracle-NVIDIA-Elea Partnership for "Rio AI City" Data Center Cluster in Brazil**

*   **Snippet:** "Rio AI City, the massive data center cluster development led by Elea Data Centers, has gained new momentum with Oracle and Nvidia signing an MOU to join the initiative as partners. The agreement was signed during the Rio Innovation Week event in the presence of mayor Eduardo Paes and other local authorities. ... Oracle will supply the servers, powered by Nvidia's AI GPUs and software. Elea, meanwhile, is responsible for the overall infrastructure – the project's shell – managing space and energy requirements according to demand and handling commercial sales."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a brand-new, material announcement on the day of earnings, indicating significant future demand for NVIDIA's AI GPUs and software in a key growth region. While the immediate Q2 FY2026 shipment impact might be limited to initial orders and planning, it provides a strong positive signal for forward-looking guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This is breaking news, likely not fully priced into consensus estimates for Q2 FY2026 or immediate guidance.

**Finding 2: Strong LatAm GPU Deliveries and Improved Supply Chain Efficiency**

*   **Snippet:** "In Latin America, Aguiar says that GPU deliveries were strong in the last quarter, driven by datacenter companies supplying large cloud service providers and by orders from big tech companies. He said there are no longer major delays in GPU shipments."
*   **Snippet:** "Regarding GPU supply capacity, the executive said it is now business as usual for Nvidia's main processor families, such as the Hopper, following the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Delivery times have fallen from up to one year to just a few months."

*   **Impact:** High. Consistent strong deliveries and significantly reduced lead times for GPUs in Latin America suggest robust demand fulfillment and a healthy supply chain, which can positively impact current and future revenue. This directly addresses the "implied shipments" aspect of the query.
*   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While general strong demand for NVIDIA GPUs is known, the specific regional strength and the dramatic improvement in delivery times for older generation (but still highly utilized) GPUs might be underappreciated.

**Finding 3: KeyBanc's Insights on GPU Supply Growth and Blackwell Shipments**

*   **Snippet:** "KeyBanc notes that NVIDIA's GPU supply grew 40% in the fiscal quarter ending in July, with an expected 20% increase by October. The new B300 chips are set to begin shipping, potentially comprising half of the Blackwell series shipments. Server rack production efficiency is also improving, with ODMs achieving an 85% yield for GB200 racks. The forecast for GB200 rack shipments has been raised from 25,000 to 30,000 units for the year."

*   **Impact:** High. This provides specific, recent data on NVIDIA's overall GPU supply and the ramp-up of Blackwell series shipments, including improved production efficiency. While not LatAm-specific, increased overall supply enables greater regional deployments and can directly impact the data center segment's revenue for Q2 FY2026 and subsequent quarters.
*   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While analysts generally expect strong Blackwell ramp-up, these specific percentage increases in supply and yield rates from a single firm could be a non-consensus detail that influences short-term expectations.

**Finding 4: LatAm Cloud Providers Offering NVIDIA GPU Instances**

*   **Snippet:** "Google Compute Engine provides users with the ability to utilize high-performance cloud GPUs that can be integrated with virtual machines... Google offers a selection of GPU models, including NVIDIA Tesla K80s, P4s, T4s, and V100s... RunPod provides a cloud infrastructure that enables seamless deployment and scaling of AI workloads with GPU-powered pods. By offering access to a wide array of NVIDIA GPUs, such as the A100 and H100... Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute... OCI offers NVIDIA GPUs designed for performance."
*   **Snippet:** "Oracle ramped up its GPU offering after formalizing its partnership with NVIDIA... New Compute Environments: GCP introduced A3 Ultra instances with NVIDIA H200 GPUs, enhancing AI performance."
*   **Snippet:** "Access a broad range of NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instances on Amazon EC2 on demand to meet the diverse computational requirements of AI, machine learning, data analytics, graphics, cloud gaming, virtual desktops, and HPC applications. ... Amazon EC2 P5 With NVIDIA H100 80GB: Tensor Core GPUs deliver the highest performance in Amazon EC2 for deep learning and HPC applications."

*   **Source:** Slashdot, SourceForge, Research AIMultiple, AWS
*   **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the widespread availability and continuous expansion of NVIDIA GPU offerings by major cloud providers in Latin America (as these are global providers with LatAm regions). While not a new "launch" within the last 3 months for advertising-specific instances, it underpins the ongoing demand and infrastructure for NVIDIA GPUs that would support advertising and other AI workloads.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely Known. The general availability of NVIDIA GPUs on major cloud platforms is well-established. The specific mention of H200 and H100 instances, however, reinforces the adoption of NVIDIA's latest high-performance GPUs.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Direct "Advertising GPU Instances":** The search did not yield explicit announcements of "advertising GPU instances" as a distinct new offering in LatAm cloud regions within the last three months. The connection to advertising workloads is an inference based on the general AI/ML capabilities of the GPUs offered.
*   **Specific LatAm Shipment Numbers:** NVIDIA does not provide regional breakdowns for its revenue or shipments, making it difficult to pinpoint exact LatAm-specific GPU shipment figures for Q2 FY2026. The information is inferred from regional demand trends and partnerships.
*   **Export Restrictions:** While NVIDIA's LatAm head stated no major delays in GPU shipments, the existence of an annual import quota of 1,700 GPUs for most LatAm countries (excluding personal computers and games) due to US export rules could still be a long-term limiting factor for extremely large, single-country deployments, though the "Rio AI City" project suggests ways around this or that the quota is not yet a binding constraint.
