## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on the impact of Microsoft's Maia chip ramp on NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings, focusing on material, non-consensus information from the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The prevailing narrative surrounding Microsoft's custom AI chip, Maia, presents a significant and likely underappreciated tailwind for NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings and forward-looking guidance. Multiple recent reports indicate that Microsoft's next-generation Maia chip, codenamed Braga (or Maia 200), has experienced substantial delays, pushing its mass production from the original 2025 timeline into 2026. These setbacks are attributed to unexpected design changes, staffing challenges, high employee turnover, and crucially, performance concerns when compared to NVIDIA's latest Blackwell chips.

Microsoft's strategic intent behind developing Maia was to reduce its heavy reliance on NVIDIA's high-performance and costly GPUs. However, with the Braga chip now delayed and expected to underperform NVIDIA's Blackwell series upon its eventual launch, Microsoft will likely remain more dependent on NVIDIA's hardware for a longer duration than initially anticipated. This extended reliance from one of NVIDIA's largest customers (Microsoft was estimated to have purchased twice as many NVIDIA AI chips as its biggest rivals in 2024) suggests sustained demand for NVIDIA's offerings, potentially exceeding market expectations that might have factored in a more aggressive ramp-up of Microsoft's in-house silicon.

While some reports from August 2025 mention that "Microsoft's Maia AI Accelerator is already deployed in production and it is handling some real workloads," this likely refers to the initial Maia 100 chip, which was announced in late 2023 and had seen "limited use beyond internal testing". The critical delay is for the *next-generation* Braga chip, which was intended to significantly scale Microsoft's custom AI chip deployment. This distinction is key and could be a non-consensus point.

NVIDIA's own Q2 FY2026 guidance, issued on May 28, 2025, projects strong revenue and gross margins, even with an acknowledged $8.0 billion loss in H20 revenue due to export control limitations. Analyst forecasts generally align with or slightly exceed this guidance. The delays and performance issues with Microsoft's Maia chip further solidify NVIDIA's near-term market position and could lead to an upside surprise in NVIDIA's data center segment revenue or a more optimistic outlook for future quarters, as a major customer's self-sufficiency efforts are lagging.

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "The launch of Microsoft's Maia AI chip, codenamed Braga, may get pushed back to 2026 due underperformance as compared to Nvidia's Blackwell chips. ... Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reportedly expects the launch of its next-generation AI chip, codenamed Braga under the Maia project, to be delayed by at least six months from its original 2025 timeline to 2026."
- **Date:** July 2, 2025
- **Source:** Stocktwits, [URL not available in snippet]
- **Impact:** High. This directly impacts Microsoft's ability to reduce reliance on NVIDIA in the near term, suggesting continued strong demand for NVIDIA's GPUs from a major customer.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general awareness of custom chips exists, the specific details of the Braga delay and its implications for NVIDIA's Q2 and forward guidance might not be fully priced in.

- **Snippet:** "Microsoft's next-generation Maia chip, code-named Braga, won't enter mass production until 2026 – at least six months behind schedule. The Information reports that the delay raises fresh doubts about Microsoft's ability to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market and underscores the steep technical and organizational hurdles of building competitive silicon."
- **Date:** June 29, 2025
- **Source:** TechSpot, [URL not available in snippet]
- **Impact:** High. Reinforces the delay and highlights the technical challenges, indicating a prolonged period of NVIDIA's market dominance for Microsoft's AI workloads.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The depth of the challenges and the resulting performance gap with Blackwell are likely not fully appreciated.

- **Snippet:** "Microsoft made unanticipated design revisions, some at the request of OpenAI, which introduced instability during simulations and set the project back by several months. The refusal of Microsoft executives to adjust project deadlines despite mounting challenges led to high stress among teams, resulting in the departure of up to one-fifth of staff on some chip design teams."
- **Date:** July 2, 2025
- **Source:** The Bridge Chronicle, [URL not available in snippet]
- **Impact:** Medium. Provides specific, non-public reasons for the delay (OpenAI requests, internal stress, staff turnover), suggesting the issues are fundamental and not easily resolved, further cementing NVIDIA's position.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. These internal operational details are unlikely to be widely known or factored into analyst models.

- **Snippet:** "Microsoft's Maia chip is reportedly expected to fall short of Nvidia's Blackwell GPU in performance. Nvidia Blackwell, unveiled in late 2024, is designed to handle the most demanding AI training and inference tasks with top-tier efficiency. This performance gap could limit Microsoft's ability to reduce its dependency on Nvidia chips in the near term."
- **Date:** June 28, 2025
- **Source:** [Publication not explicitly named, but content from "The Information"]
- **Impact:** High. The performance inferiority of Maia to Blackwell means that even when Maia eventually ramps, it may not fully displace NVIDIA's chips for the most demanding workloads, extending NVIDIA's revenue stream from Microsoft.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market might assume custom chips will be "good enough," but a significant performance gap is a material advantage for NVIDIA.

- **Snippet:** "Microsoft's Maia AI Accelerator is already deployed in production and it is handling some real workloads. Every dollar that Microsoft spends on Nvidia chips includes 60%+ gross margin. If Microsoft can build their own chips at cost, even if they're only 70% as efficient as Nvidia's, the economics might still work out in their favor. And they don't need to replace every chip just enough to give them negotiating leverage and reduce their strategic dependence."

- **Impact:** Medium. This snippet introduces a nuance: while the *next-gen* Maia is delayed, the *initial* Maia 100 might be in limited production. However, the context of other articles suggests this is not at a scale that significantly impacts NVIDIA's near-term revenue. The mention of "negotiating leverage" highlights Microsoft's long-term goal, but the current delays hinder this.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known (the general idea of custom chips for leverage). However, the *limited* nature of current Maia deployment and the *delay* of the next-gen chip are the non-consensus elements.

- **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points."
- **Date:** May 28, 2025
- **Source:** NVIDIA Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026, [URL not available in snippet]
- **Impact:** Low (as it's NVIDIA's own guidance). This is the baseline for consensus. The Maia delays suggest a potential upside to this guidance, especially in the data center segment, as Microsoft's demand for NVIDIA's chips will persist longer than anticipated.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known (NVIDIA's official guidance).

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

- **Contradiction/Nuance:** Source mentions "Microsoft's Maia AI Accelerator is already deployed in production and it is handling some real workloads" (August 20, 2025). This appears to refer to the initial Maia 100 chip, which was announced in late 2023 and had limited use. The other sources consistently refer to the *next-generation* Maia chip (Braga/Maia 200) being delayed for mass production until 2026. This distinction is crucial: the delay of the *next-gen* chip is the material non-consensus information, as it prolongs Microsoft's reliance on NVIDIA for its scaling AI infrastructure.
- **Gaps:** While the delay of Maia is clear, the exact financial impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 EPS or forward guidance is not quantified in these reports. However, the implication of sustained demand from a major hyperscaler due to the delay of its in-house alternative is a strong positive for NVIDIA. The degree to which this extended reliance is already factored into current analyst models is also a gap, but the consistent reporting of delays and performance issues suggests it might be underestimated.
