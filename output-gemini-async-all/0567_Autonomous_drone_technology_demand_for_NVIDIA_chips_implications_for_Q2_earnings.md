## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, the market is primarily focused on the company's data center performance and the ongoing implications of China export restrictions. While these are widely discussed, a deeper dive into the autonomous drone technology sector reveals several potentially material, non-consensus data points that could influence forward-looking guidance or provide an upside surprise within the broader Automotive and Robotics segment.

Analysts generally expect NVIDIA's Automotive and Robotics segments to show robust growth, with some forecasts anticipating an 80% year-over-year acceleration for Q2 FY2026. However, specific drivers within this segment, particularly related to autonomous drones and recent product launches, may not be fully priced into current consensus estimates. The recent launch of the Jetson AGX Thor, coupled with increasing demand from the defense sector and specific customer adoptions, suggests a stronger-than-anticipated trajectory for NVIDIA's embedded AI solutions in the drone market.

Here are the key findings:

---

**Structured Findings:**

- **Snippet:** "Conversely, automotive and robotics segments are expected to accelerate to 80% YoY growth, powered by new products including NVIDIA Halos safety systems for autonomous vehicles and Isaac, the world's first open humanoid robot foundation model."
- **Date:** August 24, 2025 (and earlier in August)
- **Source:** IG Singapore, IG AE (Analyst Forecasts)
- **Impact:** Medium-High. While the 80% YoY growth for the combined automotive and robotics segment is a consensus expectation, the underlying drivers, particularly the contribution from autonomous systems like drones, could be underappreciated. This strong growth rate provides a positive backdrop for drone-related revenue.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known as a general segment forecast, but the specific contribution and momentum from autonomous drones within this figure might be overlooked by some.

- **Snippet:** "Nvidia has released Jetson AGX Thor, its most powerful embedded AI computer for robots and physical devices. This new “robot brain” dramatically boosts on-board computing, offering up to 7.5x the AI performance of the current Jetson AGX Orin module at 3.5x better energy efficiency. ... Nvidia announced general availability of the Jetson AGX Thor developer kit in August 2025, positioning it to power “millions of robots across industries” from logistics and retail to agriculture and healthcare. Early adopters like Amazon's warehouse robotics division and Boston Dynamics are already integrating Thor, aiming to enable more intelligent, independent machines."
- **Date:** August 26, 2025
- **Source:** Forbes, "Nvidia's Jetson Thor Delivers A Data Center-Class AI Punch To Robotics"
- **Impact:** High. The launch of Jetson AGX Thor in August, while technically outside the Q2 FY2026 reporting period (ending July 2025), signifies a significant leap in NVIDIA's embedded AI capabilities for autonomous machines, including drones. Strong developer kit sales or pre-orders in Q2, ahead of "first shipments expected next month" (September), could indicate robust future demand and positively impact forward guidance. The mention of early adopters like Amazon and Boston Dynamics highlights immediate, high-profile traction.
- **Consensus Check:** The product launch itself is recent news, but the *magnitude of its impact* on NVIDIA's robotics segment growth and future guidance, especially for autonomous drones, might be non-consensus.

- **Snippet:** "U.S. defense giant Northrop Grumman's (NYSE: NOC) CEO Kathy Warden addressed the topic of autonomous systems -- which includes autonomous drones -- in late July on the company's Q2 earnings call 'Our investment in Beacon [a flying-mission test bed] also supports the administration's call for more next-generation autonomous systems.' Drones for a wide variety of uses are increasingly becoming autonomous, thanks to AI. This trend could benefit Nvidia, as its Jetson embedded AI computing platform can act as the 'brains' of drones and other types of robots. ... In my search of government public records for request for proposals (RFPs), Nvidia's name popped up a lot. A good number of these RFPs from defense-related agencies (and other governmental agencies) included Nvidia's GPU-equipped professional workstations and its Jetson platform."
- **Date:** August 23, 2025
- **Source:** Nasdaq, "Nvidia Stock Is Poised to Benefit From Rising Use of AI in Defense Systems and Global Surge in Defense Spending"
- **Impact:** High. The increasing adoption of NVIDIA's Jetson platform in the defense sector for autonomous drones, as evidenced by Northrop Grumman's commentary and numerous government RFPs, represents a significant, potentially under-reported revenue stream. The article explicitly states this topic is "significantly under-covered in the financial press", making it non-consensus. President Trump's "Unleashing American Drone Dominance" executive order in June further supports this trend.
- **Consensus Check:** Largely overlooked. While defense spending is known, NVIDIA's specific and growing role in autonomous defense drones is not a primary focus of mainstream analyst reports.

- **Snippet:** "Foresight is using Nvidia's Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin modules to improve the capabilities of its perception systems deployed in various use cases, with a major focus on autonomous drones and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Jetson modules, which are used in generative AI, computer vision and advanced robotics, upgrade Foresight's vision system with the computing power needed for autonomous drones and UAVs, according to Foresight."
- **Date:** July 17, 2025
- **Source:** Commercial Drone Applications Rapidly Expanding as a Huge Spotlight is Currently Shining on Drone Industry
- **Impact:** Medium. This specific customer adoption by Foresight for autonomous drones demonstrates tangible demand for NVIDIA's Jetson platform within the commercial drone sector during the Q2 period. While a single customer, it provides concrete evidence of NVIDIA's chips powering advanced drone applications, which could be indicative of broader industry trends.
- **Consensus Check:** Likely overlooked. Specific customer wins of this nature are often not highlighted in broad earnings previews.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report is widely anticipated to showcase continued strength in its data center segment, albeit with a projected moderation in growth compared to previous quarters, and ongoing challenges related to China export restrictions. However, our research indicates that the company's burgeoning involvement in autonomous drone technology, particularly through its Jetson platform, could present a positive, non-consensus narrative.

The Automotive and Robotics segment, which encompasses drone technology, is already expected to accelerate to an impressive 80% year-over-year growth in Q2 FY2026. This robust forecast provides a strong foundation. What might be less understood by the broader market is the specific momentum building within the autonomous drone sub-segment.

A key development is the recent general availability of the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor developer kit in August 2025. While this falls just outside the Q2 reporting period, its announcement and the reported early integration by major players like Amazon's warehouse robotics and Boston Dynamics suggest a significant pipeline for future revenue. Any commentary from NVIDIA regarding strong pre-orders or developer kit sales during Q2 could signal an even more optimistic outlook for the robotics segment in the coming quarters.

Furthermore, NVIDIA's deep and growing ties to the defense sector for autonomous drone applications appear to be an under-covered aspect. Mentions from Northrop Grumman's CEO about investments in autonomous systems, including drones, and the frequent appearance of NVIDIA's Jetson platform in government RFPs, indicate a solid and expanding demand from defense-related agencies. This strategic market, often less transparent, could provide a stable and high-value revenue stream that is not fully factored into current analyst models. The "Unleashing American Drone Dominance" executive order signed by President Trump in June 2025 further underscores a governmental push that could directly benefit NVIDIA.

Finally, specific customer adoptions, such as Foresight utilizing Jetson Orin Nano and AGX Orin modules for its autonomous drones, offer concrete evidence of NVIDIA's technology being deployed in real-world commercial drone applications during the reporting quarter. These individual wins, while seemingly small, collectively contribute to the overall growth story of the robotics segment and highlight the practical demand for NVIDIA's edge AI solutions in this rapidly expanding market.

In summary, while the market will be keenly focused on data center performance and China, investors should pay close attention to management's commentary on the Automotive and Robotics segment, specifically looking for any color on the traction of Jetson products in autonomous drones, particularly in defense and commercial applications. Strong performance or optimistic forward guidance related to these areas could provide a positive surprise and highlight a growing, yet underappreciated, revenue driver for NVIDIA.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

A significant gap in the publicly available information is the lack of a specific revenue breakdown for autonomous drones within NVIDIA's broader Automotive and Robotics segment. This makes it challenging to precisely quantify the direct impact of drone-specific demand on Q2 earnings. While the Jetson AGX Thor was announced in August, its direct revenue contribution to Q2 (ending July) would be limited to developer kit sales or pre-orders, with the main revenue impact expected in Q3 and beyond. However, strong indicators here could significantly influence forward guidance.
