## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst, the objective was to find and extract material, non-consensus information regarding helium supply to leak-test equipment at OSATs and any allocation notices impacting throughput, specifically for NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q2 FY2026 earnings. The search was filtered for web content published within the last three months.

Despite a focused search, no direct material, non-consensus information was found within the specified timeframe indicating helium supply allocation notices specifically impacting OSAT throughput for NVIDIA. While the importance of helium in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly for leak testing, is evident, there were no reports of recent supply shortages or allocation issues that would materially affect production or NVIDIA's upcoming earnings.

The search results did confirm the critical role of helium in semiconductor processes and the general landscape of the semiconductor supply chain.

Here are the most relevant findings from the search, acknowledging the absence of direct hits on the core query:

---

**Finding 1: Helium Leak Testing in Semiconductor Manufacturing**

*   **Snippet:** "Helium leak test. Must demonstrate a leak rate of less than 9x10-9 std cm3/s."
*   **Date:** June 6, 2025
*   **Source:** Indian Institute of Science, [URL not available in snippet]
*   **Impact:** Low. This snippet confirms the use of helium for leak testing in semiconductor-related cleanroom and utility installations. While it highlights the technical requirement for helium, it does not indicate any supply constraints or impact on throughput for OSATs or NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The use of helium for leak detection in high-vacuum and ultra-high-purity systems, common in semiconductor manufacturing, is a standard industry practice.

---

**Finding 2: Importance of Helium Leak Tightness in UHP Regulators for Semiconductors**

*   **Snippet:** "On the demand side, fab-cycle volatility and export-control regimes can shift the timing of capital projects, while end users raise expectations on helium leak thresholds, particle shedding, and dead-leg eliminationraising engineering and manufacturing costs across the category. ... Vendors compete on surface finish, dead-space minimization, springless/threadless tied-diaphragm designs, helium leak tightness and stability under varying flow and inlet pressure."
*   **Date:** August 23, 2025
*   **Source:** openPR.com (UHP Pressure Reducing Regulators Market to Reach USD 391 Million)
*   **Impact:** Low. This snippet reinforces the critical nature of "helium leak tightness" in ultra-high-purity (UHP) gas delivery systems, which are indispensable in semiconductor wafer fabrication and advanced packaging (OSATs). The mention of "end users raise expectations on helium leak thresholds" suggests increasing stringency in testing, which could indirectly increase demand for helium or advanced leak detection equipment. However, it does not point to a helium supply shortage or allocation issue directly impacting throughput.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. The demand for high purity and leak-tightness in semiconductor gas delivery is a fundamental aspect of the industry.

**Finding 3: Major Supplier of Helium to the Semiconductor Industry**

*   **Snippet:** "Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation mil. yen. 1,500. 100. Manufacture & sales of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium, hydrogen, gas-related equipment, specialty gases, electronics-related equipment & installation, compound semiconductor- producing equipment, machinery. & plants, liquefied petroleum gas, medical-use gases, medical equipment and stable isotopes."
*   **Date:** May 28, 2025
*   **Source:** Nippon Sanso Holdings Corporation (Notice of Convocation of the 21st Ordinary General Meeting of Shareho)
*   **Impact:** Low. This identifies Nippon Sanso Holdings as a significant manufacturer and seller of helium, among other gases, to the electronics and semiconductor industries. While it confirms a key player in the helium supply chain for semiconductors, the document does not contain any information about current or impending helium supply constraints, allocation notices, or their impact on semiconductor manufacturing throughput.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known within the industry that companies like Nippon Sanso are major industrial gas suppliers.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the research conducted within the last three months, there is no material, non-consensus information indicating that helium supply to leak-test equipment at OSATs is currently facing allocation notices or impacting throughput in a way that would materially affect NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings or forward-looking guidance. The snippets confirm the ongoing use and importance of helium in semiconductor manufacturing processes, particularly for leak testing, but do not suggest any recent disruptions to its supply that would pose a risk to NVIDIA's operations. The broader semiconductor industry commentary (e.g.,) focuses on other bottlenecks like CoWoS capacity and rack-scale deployments for NVIDIA, rather than helium supply.
