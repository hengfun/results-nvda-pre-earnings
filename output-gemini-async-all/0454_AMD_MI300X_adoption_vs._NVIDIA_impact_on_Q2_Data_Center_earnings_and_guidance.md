## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), the following material, non-consensus information regarding AMD's MI300X adoption and its potential impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings (quarter ending July 2025) and forward-looking guidance has been identified from web content published within the last three months.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

While AMD's MI300X is gaining traction, particularly in the inference segment with significant hyperscaler wins like Meta Platforms, its overall impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 data center earnings appears to be more nuanced than a direct competitive threat to NVIDIA's top-line dominance. NVIDIA continues to hold a commanding market share (over 85% in Q2 2025), and its own Q2 FY2026 guidance already accounts for significant headwinds like the $8 billion reduction from China/H20 business.

However, the competitive landscape is intensifying. AMD's MI300X demonstrates performance advantages in specific low-latency inference workloads, even outperforming NVIDIA's H200 with certain software stacks (vLLM). Crucially, reports suggest AMD's chips are being sold at a significantly lower price point—potentially as low as 25% of NVIDIA's H100 for similar performance. This aggressive pricing could create margin pressure for NVIDIA or give hyperscalers substantial negotiating leverage, even if NVIDIA maintains volume leadership.

AMD's own Q2 2025 data center revenue growth of 14% fell short of expectations, partly attributed to reduced China sales and a strategic shift towards the upcoming MI350 series. This suggests that while MI300X adoption is happening, supply constraints and a product transition might temper its immediate competitive bite against NVIDIA's Q2. Conversely, SemiAnalysis projects a *decline* in AMD's market share in Q2 CY2025, which would be a positive indicator for NVIDIA's performance in the same period.

NVIDIA's robust product roadmap (Blackwell, Rubin) and its entrenched CUDA software ecosystem remain formidable barriers for AMD. While AMD is improving its software stack, breaking NVIDIA's "CUDA moat" is seen as a long-term challenge. Therefore, while AMD's MI300X is a credible alternative for specific workloads and offers compelling price-performance, especially for inference, it is more likely to exert pricing pressure and capture marginal share rather than significantly erode NVIDIA's Q2 revenue or guidance, which is already factoring in other major challenges. The key non-consensus risk for NVIDIA's Q2 and guidance lies in the extent of price-performance pressure from AMD's offerings and any unexpected acceleration of MI300X deployments beyond current market expectations.

**Structured Findings:**

---

-   **Snippet:** "In Q2 2025, the current 1m term contract market rental price for the H200 is at about $2.5/hr/gpu, with wide variance and . lower pricing for low quality clouds. One-month contracts for renting the MI325X are non-existent, while one-month contracts for renting MI300X stand at over $2.5/hr, which makes the MI300X uncompetitive for renting."
-   **Date:** 2025-05-23
-   **Source:** SemiAnalysis, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGtV8mPWpE1zwotRijkuEaeSB7RCyyK2OBV5BXggD94bkp6rcN4c63jlTVvCTMP4yYWAB_3_Da-99spwSzif2YICOvtI8SJ2fimMk74Y9siKBEr_7bO4bxUG-FcQ2mhMqXpCQOBP8Dtm_s4s3xf2CLM8alK8P7hN0eQea89TRlPqKFSwZ8jqlZXoFs8dGGGBrRL6YYmorJBGorl8QpZvXAvpoaMp-2tvZzWuWWdIQ==
-   **Impact:** Medium (65). This indicates that for cloud compute rental, a segment of the market, AMD's MI300X is currently not price-competitive with NVIDIA's H200, which could limit its adoption in this specific, growing area. This suggests NVIDIA may maintain its pricing power in the rental market.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Specific rental market pricing dynamics are often not a central part of broader analyst coverage.

-   **Snippet:** "At sub-40-second latencies, the MI325X and MI300X both outperform the H100 and surprisingly the H200 with vLLM."
-   **Date:** 2025-05-23
-   **Source:** SemiAnalysis, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGtV8mPWpE1zwotRijkuEaeSB7RCyyK2OBV5BXggD94bkp6rcN4c63jlTVvCTMP4yYWAB_3_Da-99spwSzif2YICOvtI8SJ2fimMk74Y9siKBEr_7bO4bxUG-FcQ2mhMqXpCQOBP8Dtm_s4s3xf2CLM8alK8P7hN0eQea89TRlPqKFSwZ8jqlZXoFs8dGGGBrRL6YYmorJBGorl8QpZvXAvpoaMp-2tvZzWuWWdIQ==
-   **Impact:** Medium (70). This highlights a specific performance advantage for AMD in a critical inference workload (low latency with vLLM). While NVIDIA generally leads, this indicates a niche where AMD can secure wins, potentially impacting NVIDIA's inference market share or pricing for similar workloads.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The general narrative often focuses on NVIDIA's overall performance lead, so specific instances of AMD outperforming, especially against H200, are non-consensus.

---

-   **Snippet:** "We expect AMD's market share to decline in Q2 CY2025. However, with AMD's MI355X coming out later this year as well as AMD's rapid pace of software improvement, we see the potential for AMD to recapture some market share late this year or early next year."
-   **Date:** 2025-05-23
-   **Source:** SemiAnalysis, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGtV8mPWpE1zwotRijkuEaeSB7RCyyK2OBV5BXggD94bkp6rcN4c63jlTVvCTMP4yYWAB_3_Da-99spwSzif2YICOvtI8SJ2fimMk74Y9siKBEr_7bO4bxUG-FcQ2mhMqXpCQOBP8Dtm_s4s3xf2CLM8alK8P7hN0eQea89TRlPqKFSwZ8jqlZXoFs8dGGGBrRL6YYmorJBGorl8QpZvXAvpoaMp-2tvZzWuWWdIQ==
-   **Impact:** High (80). A projected decline in AMD's market share for Q2 CY2025 (which largely aligns with NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026) is a direct positive for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings, suggesting less immediate competitive pressure than some might expect. The future outlook for MI355X is relevant for NVIDIA's guidance.
-   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. Many reports focus on AMD *gaining* market share, so a projection of *decline* in the immediate quarter is a notable counter-point.

-   **Snippet:** "Building on this momentum, in June 2025, Meta Platforms announced the broad deployment of AMD Instinct MI300X for Llama 3 and Llama 4 inference. Meta Platforms also expressed strong interest in the MI350 Series and is collaborating with AMD on future AI roadmaps, including the MI400 platform."
-   **Date:** 2025-07-16

-   **Impact:** High (90). Meta Platforms is a major hyperscaler, and "broad deployment" of MI300X for Llama 3 and Llama 4 inference in June 2025 represents a significant customer win for AMD directly impacting the quarter ending July 2025. This indicates a tangible shift in demand for a portion of AI workloads, potentially reducing NVIDIA's addressable market or increasing competitive pressure for inference. The collaboration on future roadmaps impacts long-term guidance.
-   **Consensus Check:** While AMD's hyperscaler wins are known, the specific "broad deployment" for key LLMs and explicit future roadmap collaboration with a company of Meta's scale is a strong, material data point that might be underestimated by the broader market.

-   **Snippet:** "While AMD's MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia's H100, industry publication Tom's Hardware estimates that AMD's new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia's H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins."
-   **Date:** 2025-08-19
-   **Source:** 24/7 Wall St. (citing Tom's Hardware), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEp-F-3X9zEr4_n5WckoFiePvy1V5HYa7ksKTKlB06ESHVdhY4KFPjkmTU1pWlcIZzdePeSpi4wFZXYfHtfwbOAc2GXc0OQ9_r9bWKE5J7UP3hsAA3kU17N-X94k9JMv_Xpm4bq7NDKbE7uamnIqXyC5C-IHns4-jJTHFpn4uGeFsevalqK3DClj7YZ8UHqexjhCQVQshAnEnfaoyOnfcvUaOg=
-   **Impact:** High (95). This is highly material. If AMD is offering comparable performance (likely for inference) at a quarter of NVIDIA's H100 price, it creates immense pricing pressure. This could force NVIDIA to adjust its own pricing, impacting gross margins, or risk losing market share in price-sensitive segments.
-   **Consensus Check:** Highly non-consensus. While AMD is known to be cheaper, a specific estimate of 25% of NVIDIA's price for similar performance is a very aggressive and potentially overlooked competitive factor.

-   **Snippet:** "AMD's Q2 results surpassed revenue expectations but fell short in the data centre segment, which is linked to AI. The data centre revenue increased by only 14% to $3.2 billion, which did not meet expectations, especially when compared to Nvidia's much stronger growth. CEO Lisa Su mentioned reduced AI chip sales to China and the shift to the new MI350 series as factors."
-   **Date:** 2025-08-06
-   **Source:** VT Markets, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEi9YsDt3A1qnnggN-jNXiu6sL8I36CY4YpLXzYxAWohhl5tisA0vy1lRHzrploJDDMJeswvRKXZSklY6pCDeGcb8k5I0dm69UnvwVC0x3QvWn7JjzES55x_1UW533XhJpVNl2fkhuWneITi2pdfZ5jgnZ8dN33GlAkkOUCJTl_yh1Zxn5aJVFxGdadyemYF6hw3vyMjFbIewSkZezXE9s4QdlTr1vOVt10khcXKrw7ar7Yy4tAIxtS95iRAnpfOrDLk8XfSpOyf3HIVWsXvoeYW4q6-S9UXepR_c=
-   **Impact:** Medium (75). While this is AMD's earnings, the *reasons* for its data center segment's underperformance (reduced China sales and a shift to MI350) are material for NVIDIA. The "shift to MI350" could imply a temporary slowdown in MI300X orders as customers await the next generation, potentially easing competitive pressure on NVIDIA in the immediate Q2 period.
-   **Consensus Check:** The fact of AMD's Q2 data center miss is known, but the specific interpretation that the "shift to MI350" is a factor *reducing* MI300X sales in Q2, thereby potentially mitigating competitive impact on NVIDIA, could be a non-consensus read.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Performance vs. Price-Performance:** While AMD's MI300X demonstrates competitive performance in specific inference workloads and boasts higher memory capacity/bandwidth, especially against H100, NVIDIA's H100/H200 generally outperform in training and multi-node scenarios due to its mature software ecosystem (CUDA). The claim of "similar performance" for 25% of the price likely applies to specific inference tasks where MI300X excels, rather than across all AI workloads.
*   **Market Share Trajectory:** SemiAnalysis projects a *decline* in AMD's market share in Q2 CY2025, which contrasts with the broader narrative of AMD *gaining* traction and securing hyperscaler wins. This could be due to short-term supply constraints for AMD or a strategic pause by customers awaiting the MI350 series, temporarily benefiting NVIDIA in Q2 FY2026.
*   **NVIDIA's Resilience:** Despite AMD's competitive offerings and aggressive pricing, NVIDIA's continued market dominance (80-85% share), strong overall guidance (even with China headwinds), and rapid product innovation (Blackwell, Rubin) suggest that while AMD will exert pressure, it may not significantly derail NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 performance, but rather impact its long-term margin potential or force strategic adjustments.
