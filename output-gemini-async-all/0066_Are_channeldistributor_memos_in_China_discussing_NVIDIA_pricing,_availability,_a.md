## Analysis

Here's a pre-earnings research analysis on NVIDIA's (NVDA) China operations, focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact its Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

NVIDIA is navigating a complex and rapidly evolving landscape in China, marked by shifting US export controls and increasing pushback from Chinese regulators. While the US government recently granted licenses for NVIDIA to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, this approval comes with significant and unusual conditions, including a revenue-sharing agreement. Concurrently, China has issued advisories discouraging the use of these chips, raising concerns about their security and promoting domestic alternatives. These developments, coupled with a reported halt in H20 production, suggest a highly uncertain and potentially less profitable future for NVIDIA in one of its key markets. The combined effect of these factors could lead to a downward revision of future guidance or impact the profitability of its China segment, even if revenue figures meet expectations.

**Structured Findings:**

**1. Snippet:** "Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay the US government 15pc of the revenue generated from chip sales in China, in a bid to obtain export licences for the semiconductors. Sources told news publications that the deal was agreed as a condition for obtaining export licences for the Chinese market that were issued to the two companies last week. The 15pc revenue-sharing agreement will be applied to Nvidia's H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips."

- **Impact:** High. This 15% revenue share directly reduces NVIDIA's gross margins on all H20 chip sales to China, a significant and ongoing financial burden not typically associated with export licenses. This is a direct hit to profitability.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While reported, the full financial implications and the unusual nature of this "tax" on sales might not be fully priced into analyst models.

**2. Snippet:** "China has issued guidance advising companies against using Nvidia's H20 chips, part of the company's high-performance computing lineup. This formal policy directive could significantly impact Nvidia's operations in one of the world's largest markets."
- **Date:** 2025-08-19
- **Source:** ScanX, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHqgFuC0Lss3KG8QnkpVuYEieL8_21E_I2kbnLCFPtpxcHIk0_tcd0Nm6QMo3rOXsP9mD0bc0Ew5mCwZXRytDHlAAL1MetNWIebpoj5BPuu65NW3Fo3brC2HhIvnsN7qlCzNJj9wsJDFPkLo57bZ1JsSPLNFxrYzdAXaCCrcaULphbcCKJnjW1vWKuQtrZilQjLYzmSzhUm11rmbYfMVjQqR9pt-I5AOhoUiw==
- **Impact:** High. This official guidance from China creates a significant headwind for H20 sales, potentially negating the benefit of the US export licenses. It indicates a strong preference for domestic alternatives and raises questions about future demand.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While US restrictions are known, China's direct advisory against using the *licensed* H20 chips adds a new layer of complexity and risk that may not be fully appreciated.

**3. Snippet:** "Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) has directed suppliers including Amkor Technology, Samsung Electronics, and Foxconn to pause production of its H20 chips, following reports that Chinese regulators told local firms to stop buying the processors over national security concerns."

- **Impact:** High. A production halt suggests significant uncertainty in demand or a strategic pivot. It could lead to further inventory writedowns or delays in fulfilling any potential future orders, impacting revenue and profitability.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This recent development, occurring just days before earnings, might not be fully factored into analyst expectations, especially given the earlier news of license approvals.

**4. Snippet:** "On August 18, Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster said H20 prices could rise by about 18%. Combined with mounting security concerns, this could be weakening buyer interest."
- **Date:** 2025-08-25
- **Source:** Kr Asia, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE8ZdpQ7bdZK8Isyi1qMZZqhnOF3g1CKI4S1ukSptQKFcL3zriLUL_86jpSootcjXGDfARHGozRXHWMrlbP9gUxkuxlqmQptfBiOD1G61kqDMzrikSkbDR-XX5_BBY-iYK9EnVEcILLN-YSyS_doGKy7wx1k-WVEROXqz_mDbA5Yn-94cPred9MjdxUFtm-n9lUxElXvi_3NJrzqCGIigUr
- **Impact:** Medium. A potential 18% price increase, likely to offset the 15% revenue share and other compliance costs, could significantly dampen demand for H20 chips in China, especially given the availability of domestic alternatives and security concerns.
- **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the revenue share is known, the direct impact on end-user pricing and its potential to further reduce demand might not be fully modeled.

**5. Snippet:** "Although, in a recent report, global equity research firm Bernstein forecast that the company's AI chip market share in China would drop from 66pc to 54pc – partly owning to complications with resuming chip supply, as well as with domestic chipmakers in the country taking up the space left by Nvidia."

- **Impact:** Medium. A significant drop in market share indicates a long-term erosion of NVIDIA's dominance in the crucial Chinese AI market, impacting future revenue growth and competitive positioning.
- **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the *magnitude* of the projected drop and the specific reasons (supply complications *and* domestic competition) might be underappreciated.

**6. Snippet:** "NVIDIA's Q1 FY26 report shows China made up 12.5% of sales in the three months ended April 27, 2025—a share likely impacted by Trump's April 9 export curbs on the H20 chip. For Q2, the company forecasts $45 billion in revenue (±2%), factoring in an estimated $8 billion hit from lost H20 sales under the new restrictions."

- **Impact:** High. While the forecast itself is known, the underlying *reasons* for the $8 billion hit (which now include the 15% revenue share, China's advisory, and production halt) are crucial. The combination of these factors suggests that even if the revenue target is met, the profitability from China sales could be significantly lower than anticipated.
- **Consensus Check:** The revenue forecast is known, but the compounding negative effects of the 15% revenue share, China's active discouragement, and the production halt on the *quality* of that revenue and future guidance might be overlooked.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The US government granted licenses to resume H20 sales, yet NVIDIA reportedly halted production, and China is actively discouraging their use. This creates a significant disconnect between export approval and actual market viability.
*   **Gap:** The exact volume of H20 chips that were in inventory before the production halt, and the current status of that inventory, is not clear. This could impact the immediate revenue recognition for Q2 FY2026.
*   **Gap:** The specific details of "channel/distributor memos" or "WeChat official accounts" discussing pricing and availability directly from the Chinese side are still limited. Most information is from news reports about government actions or analyst interpretations. More direct insights from the Chinese distribution network would be valuable.
*   **Gap:** The long-term impact of China's push for domestic alternatives on NVIDIA's other product lines (beyond H20) is not fully detailed in these snippets.
