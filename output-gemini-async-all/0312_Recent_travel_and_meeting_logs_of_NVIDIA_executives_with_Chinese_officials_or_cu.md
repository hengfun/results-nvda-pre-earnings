## Analysis

NVIDIA is poised to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, with significant attention on its performance in the crucial Chinese market. Recent developments indicate a complex and evolving landscape, presenting several non-consensus factors that could materially impact the company's upcoming report and forward-looking guidance. While the market is aware of the US government's fluctuating stance on chip exports to China, the nuanced reactions from the Chinese government and NVIDIA's strategic responses introduce considerable uncertainty.

Key non-consensus information suggests that despite the recent US approval for H20 chip sales to China, the actual uptake may be significantly hampered by internal Chinese resistance and security concerns. Furthermore, NVIDIA's reported halt in H20 production and its pricing strategy for future China-specific chips, coupled with the accelerating development of domestic alternatives in China, point to a more challenging and less predictable revenue stream from the region than widely assumed.

Here are the key findings:

### Material Non-Consensus Findings

**1. Chinese Government's Push to Restrict H20 Chip Purchases Despite US Approval**

*   **Snippet:** "Groups in the Chinese government are pushing to restrict companies from purchasing Nvidia's H20 chips, according to a recent Financial Times report." "The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet watchdog, recently posted a notice on its website referring to alleged 'serious security issues' with Nvidia's computer chips. It said U.S. experts on AI had said such chips have 'mature tracking and location and remote shutdown technologies' and Nvidia had been asked to explain any such risks and provide documentation about the issue." "According to industry sources and media reports, China's tech firms have been dissuaded by the country's regulators from purchasing H20 chips."
*   **Date:** August 21, 2025, August 22, 2025
*   **Source:** Morningstar (citing Financial Times), MarketWatch (citing Financial Times), South China Morning Post (citing Cyberspace Administration of China), Reuters
*   **Impact:** High. While the US government has allowed H20 sales to resume (with a 15% levy), active dissuasion from the Chinese government could severely limit actual sales volume, directly impacting Q3 FY226 guidance and future revenue projections from China. This directly contradicts the positive sentiment around the resumption of sales.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The market is largely aware of the US lifting the ban on H20 sales, but the extent of the Chinese government's internal resistance and "security concerns" is likely underappreciated and could lead to a significant downside surprise in China-related revenue.

**2. NVIDIA Reportedly Halts H20 Chip Production**

*   **Snippet:** "Trade publication The Information reported on Thursday that Nvidia instructed Arizona-based Amkor Technology to stop production of its H20 chips this week and also notified Korea's Samsung Electronics, citing two people with direct knowledge of the communications." "The H20 chip faces resistance from the Chinese government, with reports indicating that Nvidia has requested its supply chain partners to halt production of the H20."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025, August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** Reuters (citing The Information), Digitimes (citing reports)
*   **Impact:** High. Halting production of the H20, even if temporary, indicates a significant issue with the viability or demand for this specific chip in the Chinese market. This suggests that the "resumption of sales" may not translate into meaningful revenue in the near term, further impacting Q3 guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. This directly contradicts the narrative of resumed H20 sales and suggests a deeper, more immediate problem with NVIDIA's China strategy for the H20.

**3. NVIDIA's Pricing Strategy for China-Specific Blackwell Chips and Gross Margin Impact**

*   **Snippet:** "To counter a 15% revenue-sharing mandate, NVIDIA plans to raise prices on its China-specific Blackwell chips by 18%. While this protects profits, it may slightly lower gross margins from 71% to 69.3%."
*   **Date:** August 26, 2025
*   **Source:** MarketPulse
*   **Impact:** Medium. While NVIDIA aims to offset the US government's levy, the 18% price increase on China-specific Blackwell chips could face resistance in a market increasingly wary of US chips and pushing for domestic alternatives. The projected slight reduction in gross margins (from 71% to 69.3%) is a specific financial detail that could impact profitability beyond current consensus estimates if sales volumes are also affected.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The specific pricing strategy and its direct impact on gross margins for China-specific chips are likely not fully factored into broader analyst models, which might focus more on overall revenue.

**4. Jensen Huang's "Surprise" at China's Security Concerns and Ongoing Dialogue**

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was surprised by Beijing's questioning of the security of its H20 artificial intelligence chips and that it would be up to the US government to decide whether the company can produce a new product for the Chinese market." "Huang said Nvidia was 'surprised' by the doubts from China about the H20 as 'they've requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20 for some time and I've worked quite hard to help them secure the licences'." "Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a 'backdoor' security risk, Huang said."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025
*   **Source:** South China Morning Post, Reuters
*   **Impact:** Medium. Huang's public "surprise" and the ongoing need to "reassure" Beijing highlight the significant diplomatic and political hurdles NVIDIA faces in China. This indicates a lack of clear resolution and continued uncertainty, which could lead to delays in new chip approvals (like the B30/B30A) and ongoing sales challenges, affecting forward guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the geopolitical tensions are known, the specific detail of Huang's surprise and the active, ongoing dialogue to address security concerns suggests a more fragile and less stable market environment than a simple "ban lifted" narrative implies.

**5. Progress of Chinese Home-Grown AI Chips and Competition**

*   **Snippet:** "Meanwhile, there are growing signs that China may be close to pulling off home-grown AI stacking that could replace Nvidia's products. On Thursday, Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek said the country would soon have home-grown 'next-generation' chips for AI stacking, fanning speculation over breakthroughs that may have been achieved." "Chinese chipmaker Cambricon Technologies also reported stellar numbers, posting a company-record first-half profit on momentum created by the introduction of DeepSeek in January. Cambricon – a Huawei Technologies competitor on the Chinese AI market – was up as much as 10.2% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and closed higher by 3.2%. China is working to fill gaps in its supply chain in the absence of clarity about the availability of Nvidia products in the domestic market. Its success underscores the global pace and potential of AI development."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025, August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** South China Morning Post, Kiplinger
*   **Impact:** Medium. The accelerating progress of Chinese domestic AI chip development, with specific mentions of DeepSeek and Cambricon, poses a long-term threat to NVIDIA's market share in China. While not directly impacting Q2, this could significantly influence NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance and long-term strategy for the region, potentially leading to a more conservative outlook.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the general idea of China developing its own chips is known, the specific recent progress and positive financial results of local competitors like Cambricon, tied to new products like DeepSeek, provide concrete evidence of this accelerating trend that may not be fully priced into NVIDIA's future growth prospects in China.

### Contradictions and Gaps

*   **Contradiction:** The US government's approval for H20 sales (with a 15% levy) directly conflicts with reports of the Chinese government actively discouraging purchases and NVIDIA reportedly halting H20 production. This creates significant uncertainty regarding the actual revenue potential from H20 chips.
*   **Gap:** The exact volume of H20 chips that NVIDIA has "ready to go" and the specific timeline for the B30/B30A chip's approval and market entry in China remain unclear. The extent to which Chinese customers will accept the 18% price increase on the new Blackwell chips, given their security concerns and the availability of domestic alternatives, is also a significant unknown. The financial impact of the reported H20 production halt is not yet quantified.
