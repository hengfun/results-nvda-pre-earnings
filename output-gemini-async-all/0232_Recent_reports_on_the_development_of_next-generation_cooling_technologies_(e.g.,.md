## Analysis

NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance are likely to be significantly influenced by the accelerating adoption of advanced cooling technologies in data centers. The increasing power density of AI GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's Blackwell platform, is making traditional air cooling obsolete, driving a rapid shift towards liquid cooling solutions. While direct-to-chip liquid cooling is gaining immediate traction, the industry is already looking towards immersion cooling as the future for even higher-density chips, though its widespread adoption faces current hurdles.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

The demand for high-performance computing and AI workloads is pushing data center infrastructure to its limits, with rack power densities now frequently exceeding 135 kW, and some AI racks even reaching 150-200 kW. This intense heat generation necessitates a fundamental shift in cooling strategies. NVIDIA's latest AI platform, the Blackwell Ultra chip, is designed to be fully liquid-cooled, featuring integrated cold plates and optimized thermal interfaces. This strategic move by NVIDIA is seen as a pivotal moment, signaling an industry-wide recognition that liquid cooling is essential for next-generation computing.

The rollout of NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72 rack servers in 2025 is expected to be a major catalyst, accelerating the adoption of liquid cooling in AI data centers. Projections indicate that liquid cooling penetration in AI data centers will surge from 14% in 2024 to 33% in 2025. This rapid increase is driven by hyperscale data centers and high-performance computing facilities, which require superior thermal management to maintain optimal GPU performance and energy efficiency.

Looking further ahead, immersion cooling is anticipated to become the inevitable solution for future, even more powerful chips. NVIDIA's "Rubin Ultra" GPU, scheduled for release around 2027, is expected to drive a significant boom in the immersion cooling market between 2027 and 2028. However, a key challenge currently hindering broader immersion cooling adoption is NVIDIA's lack of lifespan certification for their GPUs when used in immersion cooling environments. Additionally, fully submerging servers requires dedicated infrastructure, unlike liquid cooling, which can often be integrated into existing air-cooled systems via cold plates.

The overall immersion cooling market for data centers is experiencing robust growth, projected to reach approximately $2 billion in 2025 and grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25% from 2025 to 2033. This growth is fueled by the increasing power density of servers, the rising demand for HPC, and a growing focus on energy efficiency and environmental regulations. Data center operators are increasingly adopting hybrid cooling strategies, combining liquid systems with traditional air cooling, as a new normal rather than a temporary workaround.

**Structured Findings:**

    *   **Impact:** High. This provides specific market penetration forecasts directly tied to NVIDIA's product rollout within the current fiscal year. A near doubling of liquid cooling penetration in AI data centers in a single year suggests significant revenue opportunities for NVIDIA and its cooling partners.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The general trend of increasing liquid cooling is known, but these specific penetration figures and the direct link to GB200 NVL72 rollout for 2025 are more granular and potentially non-consensus.

*   **Snippet:** "While liquid cooling dominates today, NVIDIA is expected to embrace immersion cooling post-Rubin Ultra, with the market set to take off between 2027-2028, ZDNet reports. ... While NVIDIA adopts liquid cooling, it does not offer lifespan certification for immersion cooling on their GPUs, which further hinders the adoption, the report notes."

    *   **Source:** ZDNet (cited by [News] NVIDIA's Rubin Ultra Seen Driving Immersion Cooling Boom by 2027-28), [URL not provided in snippet]
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This highlights a future growth driver (Rubin Ultra and immersion cooling) but also a current bottleneck (lack of certification). The absence of certification could delay broader adoption of immersion cooling for NVIDIA GPUs in the near term, potentially impacting revenue for immersion cooling providers and indicating a future R&D/certification focus for NVIDIA.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The long-term trend towards immersion cooling is emerging, but NVIDIA's specific stance on certification and its impact on adoption is likely non-consensus and a key detail for market participants.

*   **Snippet:** "The immersion cooling market for data centers is experiencing robust growth, driven by the increasing demand for high-density computing and the need for more energy-efficient cooling solutions. The market, currently valued at approximately $2 billion in 2025, is projected to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25% from 2025 to 2033."
