## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information regarding NVIDIA's CoWoS packaging yields and potential impact on upcoming earnings and guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

Recent reports indicate that NVIDIA's advanced GPU packaging, particularly for its Blackwell architecture, has encountered initial yield challenges. Industry analysts estimate a "five-percentage-point yield penalty" in the early CoWoS-L packaging runs for Blackwell. Furthermore, a report from Fubon Financial, a well-connected Taiwanese financial institution, suggests that Blackwell GB200 yields are still considered "subpar" several quarters after its anticipated launch, leading to difficulties in ramping up production. This non-consensus information, if accurate, could imply higher manufacturing costs and potentially impact NVIDIA's gross margins for Q2 FY2026, as well as its ability to meet the surging demand for its latest AI accelerators.

Looking ahead, the Fubon report also raises concerns about the next-generation Rubin GPU. While NVIDIA has refuted claims of a delay, the report suggests a redesign of Rubin due to competitive pressure from AMD's MI450 and highlights that NVIDIA's large reticle-sized dies are "not likely to yield well on a new process" like TSMC's N2. This indicates that yield learning curves for large-reticle CoWoS packages remain a critical factor for NVIDIA's future product launches and could affect forward-looking guidance for 2026.

Despite these potential yield challenges, TSMC is aggressively expanding its CoWoS capacity, with projections to reach 70,000-80,000 wafers per month by the end of 2025. NVIDIA has secured a significant portion (over 70%) of TSMC's CoWoS-L capacity for 2025, underscoring the high demand but also the ongoing supply chain bottleneck. The adoption of a chiplet design for Rubin is a strategic move that could help mitigate yield issues associated with very large monolithic dies in the long term.

**Structured Findings:**

---

-   **Snippet:** "However, such speed has a cost: industry analysts estimate roughly a five-percentage-point yield penalty in the initial CoWoS-L packaging runs for Blackwell, compared to mature processes. In other words, NVIDIA sacrificed a bit of manufacturing efficiency to push Blackwell out the door on schedule."

-   **Source:** The Annual Cadence Gamble: Can NVIDIA Keep Launching a New Platform Each Spring?, URL not available
-   **Impact:** High. A 5% yield penalty directly impacts manufacturing costs and gross margins for NVIDIA's current flagship product, Blackwell, which is a key revenue driver. This could lead to a downward surprise on profitability.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While supply chain constraints are known, a specific yield penalty percentage for Blackwell's initial CoWoS-L runs is likely non-consensus and could surprise the market.

---

-   **Snippet:** "To this day, three quarters after the originally anticipated launch time, Blackwell GB200 yields are considered subpar, and companies have struggled to ramp GB200."
-   **Date:** 2025-08-13
-   **Source:** Nvidia Rubin Delayed? Implications, URL not available
-   **Impact:** High. "Subpar" yields for GB200, a critical component of the Blackwell platform, suggest ongoing production inefficiencies and potential limitations in meeting demand, directly affecting revenue and profitability for the current quarter and near future.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. NVIDIA has generally maintained a positive outlook on its production ramp. This specific detail from a Taiwanese financial source (Fubon) suggests a more challenging reality than widely acknowledged.

-   **Snippet:** "Some choice quotes from Fubon: 'The first version of Rubin was already taped out in late June, but Nvidia is now redesigning the chip to better match AMD's upcoming MI450.' 'We think the next tape out schedule will be in late September of October, and based on the tapeout schedule, the Rubin volume will be limited in 2026.' ... 'Nvidia is likely to stay with N3P or some other N3 class process for Rubin. This is because Nvidia does large reticle sized dies and such dies are not likely to yield well on a new process. N2 is a brand-new process with initial production slated for H2 2025 and may not be ideal for Rubin.'"

-   **Source:** Nvidia Rubin Delayed? Implications, URL not available
-   **Impact:** High. A redesign and potential delay for Rubin, coupled with concerns about large reticle yield on new processes, could significantly impact NVIDIA's competitive positioning and revenue projections for 2026, affecting forward-looking guidance.
-   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA refuted the delay, the detailed reasoning from Fubon, particularly regarding yield challenges for large dies on new processes, is likely non-consensus and could be a significant concern for future guidance.

-   **Snippet:** "TSMC plans to increase its CoWoS packaging capacity to 80,000 wafers per month by Q4 2025 to support demand for Rubin and Apple's M5 SoC, among other products."
-   **Date:** 2025-06-13
-   **Source:** NVIDIA Plans to Offer Next-Gen Rubin Accelerator Samples This September - Kontronn, URL not available
-   **Impact:** Medium. While positive for long-term supply, the aggressive ramp-up to 80,000 wafers/month by Q4 2025 highlights the extreme demand and potential for continued bottlenecks in the short term, especially if yield issues persist.
-   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. TSMC's CoWoS capacity expansion has been a frequently discussed topic in the industry.

-   **Snippet:** "Rubin will adopt chiplet partitioning for the first time in NVIDIA's product line and is planned for TSMC's N3P process with CoWoS-L packaging. ... The physical compute die layout will utilize a larger reticle area compared to the current generation."
-   **Date:** 2025-08-22
-   **Source:** NVIDIA "Rubin" Platform Enters Trial Production at TSMC, CEO Jensen Huang Confirms, URL not available
-   **Impact:** Medium. The adoption of chiplets is a strategic move to improve yield and flexibility for large, complex designs, which is directly relevant to the query. However, it's a future-looking development for Rubin, not directly impacting Q2 FY2206 earnings.
-   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. NVIDIA's move to chiplets for Rubin has been discussed as a logical progression for advanced GPUs.
