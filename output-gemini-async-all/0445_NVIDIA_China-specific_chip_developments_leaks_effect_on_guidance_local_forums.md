## Analysis

Here's an analysis of material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report and forward-looking guidance, with a focus on China-specific chip developments.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA is reporting its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, and while analyst sentiment has generally been bullish, recent developments in China present a significant, potentially non-consensus headwind.

Previously, a notable development in August 2025 was a reported revenue-sharing agreement between NVIDIA, AMD, and the US government, allowing the resumption of H20 AI chip sales to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue. This deal was widely seen as a positive, potentially unlocking billions in revenue and mitigating the $4.5 billion charge NVIDIA took in Q1 FY226 due to initial H20 export restrictions. Analysts had even factored in a potential boost to Q2 revenue, with some suggesting it could reclaim up to $8 billion and increase overall revenue by over 10% if China sales doubled.

However, a critical and more recent development, reported on August 22, 2025, indicates a significant reversal. NVIDIA has reportedly instructed its suppliers (including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics) to *halt* H20 chip production. This decision stems from "unofficial window guidance" from the Chinese government, which has advised local tech companies to cease purchasing H20 chips, citing security concerns. This move by Beijing directly contradicts the positive implications of the US revenue-sharing deal and introduces a new layer of uncertainty and potential revenue loss for NVIDIA in the crucial Chinese market.

While NVIDIA's Q2 guidance already reflected an $8 billion reduction from the halted China/H20 business, the expectation was that the revenue-sharing deal would help recover some of this. The new directive from China to avoid H20 chips suggests that this recovery may not materialize, or could even worsen the situation, potentially impacting Q2 results if the halt occurred early enough, but more certainly affecting forward-looking guidance for Q3 and beyond. This ongoing geopolitical tension and China's push for domestic alternatives like Huawei's Ascend chips further complicate NVIDIA's long-term strategy in the region.

The market may not have fully priced in the implications of this recent H20 production halt, as many analyst reports published just days before earnings were still discussing the *benefits* of the revenue-sharing agreement. This makes the H20 production halt a material, non-consensus piece of information.

**Structured Findings:**

---

*   **Snippet:** "A significant development emerged in August 2025 where NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) agreed to share 15% of revenues from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licences. This arrangement allows NVIDIA to resume H20 AI chip sales designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export controls. The financial impact warrants attention. While China represents 13% of NVIDIA's revenue by customer billing location in FY 2025, actual contribution may be higher due to trans-shipment orders. Assuming restriction removal doubles China sales while other regions remain flat, this could boost NVIDIA's revenue by over 10%."

*   **Impact:** Medium. This snippet outlines the *expected positive impact* of the revenue-sharing deal, which was likely incorporated into some analyst models. However, the subsequent halt in production (see next snippet) negates this positive.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This agreement was reported by several financial news outlets in mid-August.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has told component suppliers to suspend work related to its H20 chip, according to multiple reports. ... Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly has told suppliers to suspend production of its H20 chip, after Beijing asked local firms to avoid using the chip tailored for the Chinese market due to security concerns."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a direct contradiction to the expected positive impact of the revenue-sharing deal. The halt in production due to Chinese government pressure is a significant negative development that could materially impact Q2 results (if the halt was early enough) and certainly future guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Emerging Consensus. While reported by several outlets on August 22nd, its full implications might not be entirely factored into all analyst models, especially those published earlier in the week or month that focused on the revenue-sharing deal.

*   **Snippet:** "China has advised local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 processors, particularly for government or national security purposes, complicating Nvidia's efforts to regain lost revenue from China. ... While the directive stops short of an outright ban, Beijing has placed the H20 under the same kind of partial restrictions previously imposed on Tesla vehicles, Apple iPhones, and Micron chips, citing security concerns."

*   **Impact:** High. This provides crucial context for the H20 production halt, indicating a deliberate strategy by the Chinese government to limit reliance on NVIDIA's chips, even those designed to be compliant. This suggests a more persistent and challenging environment for NVIDIA in China.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Emerging Consensus. While reported, the full implications of this "unofficial guidance" and its direct link to the production halt might not be fully appreciated by all investors.

---

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's Q1 delivered a robust artificial intelligence (AI) narrative with notable caveats. Revenue rose sharply, driven by continued data centre strength. However, new licensing requirements for H20 chip exports to China triggered a $4.5 billion charge, causing gross margins to plunge to 60.5% from the expected 70.6%."

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia has been crystal clear about where it expects to go this quarter. In the May quarter (fiscal Q1 2026), NVDA delivered $44.1 billion in revenue (up 69% year-over-year).

*   **Impact:** Medium. This confirms that NVIDIA's Q2 guidance already accounted for a significant hit from China. The new H20 halt means the *recovery* anticipated from the revenue-sharing deal might not materialize, leading to a potential miss on the higher end of expectations or a more conservative outlook.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This was part of NVIDIA's official guidance.

*   **Impact:** Low (for Q2 earnings), Medium (for forward guidance). This indicates NVIDIA's long-term strategy for China, but these new chips are not expected to impact Q2 results. However, any updates on their development or expected launch could influence future guidance.
*   **Consensus Check:** Emerging consensus. While some reports mention this, the specifics and timeline are still somewhat speculative.
