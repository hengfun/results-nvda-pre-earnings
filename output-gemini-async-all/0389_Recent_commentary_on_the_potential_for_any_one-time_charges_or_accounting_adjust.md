## Analysis

NVIDIA is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, with significant attention on any potential one-time charges or accounting adjustments. While the major $4.5 billion charge related to H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations due to U.S. export restrictions to China was recorded in Q1 FY2026, its lingering effects and new related agreements are expected to influence the Q2 results and forward guidance.

The primary material information revolves around the ongoing impact of these export controls and a recently established revenue-sharing agreement for sales to China. Analysts are largely factoring in these known headwinds, but the precise financial implications and any unexpected costs associated with the ramp-up of new products like Blackwell could still present non-consensus surprises.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations."
    *   **Date:** May 28, 2025
    *   **Source:** NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGhrrtl1bO6MQinFOuJg7jnu7ecPtjIAPvUcPqeGXCWu1Mwxrp-kFIMFSdLvblHj1_dXUkrhZF8gix5HWGIjtswKNqbytXx6cu2xE4JMU4vWk7_qYAP49tAt92-7mm9lxZqKxiLBSM_dMTP12VkG7cBTd3Zp-qWVPXlhrhrIgnYPP7J74zI8tVyAgzClL7xIViasgjM1j2c-BWJ6Czq5g==]
    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct, significant revenue reduction for Q2 FY2026, impacting the top line and profitability. While previously guided, any deviation from this $8.0 billion figure could be material.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known and factored into analyst expectations following NVIDIA's Q1 FY2026 earnings call.

*   **Snippet:** "After entering a deal to resume H20 chip sales to China, despite revenue-sharing conditions, NVIDIA could reclaim as much as US$8 billion during Q2, mitigating past losses caused by restrictions."
    *   **Date:** August 25, 2025

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While the potential to "reclaim" revenue is positive, the "revenue-sharing conditions" (a 15% levy mentioned in other snippets) represent an ongoing accounting adjustment that will reduce gross margins on these specific sales. The net impact of the resumed sales versus the levy is a key watch item.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The existence of the deal and the 15% levy are known, but the exact magnitude of reclaimed revenue and the net impact on profitability for Q2 might still have some non-consensus elements depending on actual sales volumes.

*   **Snippet:** "Visible Alpha consensus for the gross profit of this segment in Q2 26 has remained between $30.0 billion and $31.0 billion, due to the higher costs associated with the Blackwell ramp. The consensus gross profit margin for the Data Center segment for FY 2026 continued to decrease, falling over 100bps to 74.1% from the 75.2% estimated at the end of last quarter."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. While not a one-time charge, "higher costs associated with the Blackwell ramp" could lead to lower-than-expected gross margins if the impact is greater than currently anticipated by the consensus. This could be a subtle, non-consensus factor affecting profitability.
    *   **Consensus Check:** The general trend of decreasing gross profit margin for FY2026 due to Blackwell ramp costs is becoming consensus, but the exact magnitude of these costs and their impact on Q2 margins could still hold surprises.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   There are no explicit contradictions in the provided snippets regarding one-time charges or accounting adjustments for Q2 FY2026. The information consistently points to the ongoing impact of the H20 export restrictions and the new revenue-sharing agreement.
*   A significant gap is the absence of any *new, unanticipated* one-time charges (e.g., legal settlements, new inventory write-downs beyond H20, or restructuring charges) specifically for Q2 FY2026 that are not already widely discussed in the context of the China export controls. The search results primarily focus on the carryover effects and the 15% levy as the main "adjustments."
*   While the "higher costs associated with the Blackwell ramp" are mentioned, there's no specific quantification or indication that these will manifest as a *one-time charge* rather than an ongoing pressure on gross margins. The degree to which these costs are already priced into the guided gross margins (71.8% GAAP, 72.0% non-GAAP) is a potential area for non-consensus impact.
