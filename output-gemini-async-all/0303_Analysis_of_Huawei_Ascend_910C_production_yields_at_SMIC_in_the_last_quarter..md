## Analysis

Here's an analysis of Huawei Ascend 910C production yields at SMIC, focusing on material, non-consensus information from the last quarter (May-July 2025) and recent publications (within the last 3 months), relevant to NVIDIA's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report.

### Human-Readable Analysis

Recent reports indicate a mixed and somewhat contradictory picture regarding Huawei's Ascend 910C AI chip production at SMIC. While earlier in 2025 there were claims of improved yield rates reaching 40% and making the production line profitable, more recent information suggests ongoing challenges.

Crucially, a report from early June 2025 indicates that Huawei has **postponed the mass production of the Ascend 910C until the end of 2025** due to "certain technical issues." This directly contradicts earlier expectations for mass production and shipments in Q1 or May 2025. This delay suggests that Huawei's ability to ramp up its most advanced AI chip to compete with NVIDIA in the Chinese market is facing more significant hurdles than previously understood, at least in the immediate term.

Adding to this, a Mizuho Securities analyst in mid-May 2025 estimated the production yield for the Ascend 910C at SMIC to be around **30%**. This figure is lower than the 40% reported in February/March 2025, suggesting either a regression in yield improvement or a more conservative, non-consensus assessment of the ongoing manufacturing difficulties. A 30% yield is significantly below the 70% considered commercially viable for advanced chips, implying higher costs and lower output.

Looking further ahead, there are reports from today, August 27, 2025, that SMIC intends to **double its manufacturing capacity for 7nm chips in 2026**, with Huawei being its largest customer. While this points to a long-term strategic push by China for self-sufficiency and potential future competition for NVIDIA, the immediate impact on NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings (ending July 2025) is likely muted given the reported delays and current low yields of the 910C.

In summary, the most material and non-consensus information for NVIDIA's upcoming earnings is the reported **postponement of Ascend 910C mass production** and the **lower-than-previously-reported yield estimates**. These factors suggest that Huawei's competitive threat in the Chinese AI chip market for the current quarter and near-term future may be less severe than some might have anticipated, potentially providing a slight tailwind or reducing downside risk for NVIDIA's China revenue in the short term. However, the long-term intent for SMIC to expand 7nm capacity for Huawei remains a competitive factor for future guidance.

### Structured Findings

**Finding 1: Postponement of Ascend 910C Mass Production**

*   **Snippet:** "Huawei was about to begin the mass production of the Ascend 910C chips this month, but the company has reportedly postponed its plan. A new input reveals that the tech giant might initiate the respective activity by the end of this year. X tipster @Jukanlosreve says that Huawei has postponed the Ascend 910C mass production to the end of this year. The company has delayed the AI chip manufacturing due to certain technical issues appeared in the chipset."
*   **Date:** June 6, 2025
*   **Source:** Huawei reportedly postponed Ascend 910C AI chip mass production, Huawei Central, [https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-reportedly-postponed-ascend-910c-ai-chip-mass-production/](https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-reportedly-postponed-ascend-910c-ai-chip-mass-production/)
*   **Impact:** High. This is a significant delay in Huawei's ability to bring its most advanced AI chip to market at scale. For NVIDIA, this means reduced immediate competition in the crucial Chinese market, potentially leading to better-than-expected China revenue or less pressure on pricing for its compliant chips in the short term (Q2 FY2026 and Q3 FY2026).
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Non-consensus. Earlier reports (Nov 2024, Feb 2025, April 2025) indicated mass production starting in Q1 2025 or mass shipments by May 2025. This June 2025 report of a postponement to year-end due to technical issues is a direct contradiction and likely not fully priced into consensus expectations for NVIDIA's competitive landscape.

**Finding 2: Lower-than-Expected Production Yield for Ascend 910C**

*   **Snippet:** "According to Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh, only 30% of the Ascend 910c chips meet production standards. That's a crushing blow for Huawei, which is banking on the 910c to fill the market gap left by NVIDIA's H20 chips, now banned from export to China."
*   **Date:** May 18, 2025
*   **Source:** Ascend 910c Production Crisis — Can Huawei Hit 700000 Shipments Amid 30% Yields?, Hardware Busters, [https://hardwarebusters.com/ascend-910c-production-crisis-can-huawei-hit-700000-shipments-amid-30-yields/](https://hardwarebusters.com/ascend-910c-production-crisis-can-huawei-hit-700000-shipments-amid-30-yields/) (Also cited in,)
*   **Impact:** High. A 30% yield rate is significantly below the 70% considered commercially viable. This implies high manufacturing costs and severely constrained supply, limiting Huawei's ability to meaningfully displace NVIDIA in the Chinese AI chip market in the near term. This specific analyst estimate, published in May, provides a more recent and potentially more pessimistic view than earlier reports of 40% yields.
*   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus. While initial reports in late 2024 cited 20% yields, some February/March 2025 reports claimed an improvement to 40% and profitability. The Mizuho analyst's 30% estimate in May 2025 suggests either a re-evaluation or a more current, challenging reality, making it a non-consensus data point.

**Finding 3: SMIC's Planned 7nm Capacity Doubling for 2026**

*   **Snippet:** "The Financial Times also reported that SMIC intends to double its manufacturing capacity for 7 nanometer chips next year, with Huawei being its largest customer for these chips."
*   **Date:** August 27, 2025
*   **Source:** China's chipmakers aim to triple AI chip output in 2026 - report By Investing.com, [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinas-chipmakers-aim-to-triple-ai-chip-output-in-2026--report-3580430](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinas-chipmakers-aim-to-triple-ai-chip-output-in-2026--report-3580430) (Also cited in)
*   **Impact:** Medium. This is a forward-looking statement for 2026, indicating a strategic intent for China to increase domestic AI chip production and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like NVIDIA. While not directly impacting Q2 FY2026 earnings, it is material for NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance and long-term competitive strategy in China.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known/Emerging consensus. This report is from today, indicating it's fresh news. The general trend of China's push for semiconductor self-sufficiency is known, but specific capacity expansion plans like this are new details that will likely become part of the broader market narrative.
