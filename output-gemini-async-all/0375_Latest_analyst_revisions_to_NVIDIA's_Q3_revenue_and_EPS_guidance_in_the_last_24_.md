## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is set to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, August 27, 2025. As a pre-earnings research analyst, the focus is on identifying material, non-consensus information regarding Q3 FY2026 revenue and EPS guidance, particularly any revisions within the last 24 hours. While explicit analyst revisions published within the exact 24-hour window are limited, recent "street expectations" and specific analyst estimates from the last few days provide crucial insights into market sentiment and potential guidance.

The overall sentiment leading into the earnings report is highly anticipatory, with investors closely watching NVIDIA's guidance for Q3 FY2026 as a key indicator of the AI market's trajectory. The transition to the Blackwell platform and the easing of supply bottlenecks are central themes.

*   **Impact:** High. This provides a wider range of revenue expectations for Q3 FY2026, indicating the variability in analyst outlook. A guidance outside this range, particularly on the lower end, could have a significant impact.
*   **Consensus Check:** This represents a range of current expectations, suggesting a degree of divergence among analysts regarding the precise revenue outlook.

**4. TradingView's "Next Quarter" (Q3 FY2026) Consensus Estimates**
*   **Snippet:** "In the next quarter EPS is expected to reach 1.01 USD." and "In the next quarter NVIDIA Corporation revenue is expected to reach ‪46.05 B‬ USD."
*   **Date:** August 25, 2025
*   **Source:** NVDA Forecast — Price Target — Prediction for 2026 - TradingView, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFdAB_YD_2Ti8blJhaCSAs18EsIf7F4JjxWoryptSIBCaFVFv5Dr7VgsxN46sQSnm27Po0kEFRbDwZUj-5FOSbPuzB4RElEEnRHzCKznEehKmVCXUOtKhjLyGocKQdJwGAgzMg_j6dWwlkNGG_0ZflBoX3H]
*   **Impact:** Medium. These are consensus estimates for the upcoming quarter (Q3 FY2026). Comparing these to the "street expectations" from other sources (e.g., $55 billion revenue and $1.25 EPS from MarketMinute) highlights a potential gap between a more conservative consensus and more optimistic "street" expectations.
*   **Consensus Check:** These are presented as consensus estimates, which are widely known. However, the *difference* between these and the more aggressive "street" expectations could be considered non-consensus if the market is leaning towards the higher end.

### Analysis and Contradictions/Gaps:

There's a noticeable spread in the Q3 FY2026 revenue and EPS expectations. While TradingView reports a consensus of $46.05 billion revenue and $1.01 EPS, "some on the street" are expecting a Q3 FY2026 revenue guide closer to $55 billion with EPS around $1.25. Another source indicates a broader range of $52.5 billion to $57 billion for Q3 FY2026 revenue expectations. Wedbush's specific Q3 EPS estimate is $1.10.

This divergence suggests that while there's a general consensus, a more optimistic segment of the market is anticipating significantly higher guidance. If NVIDIA's actual Q3 FY2026 guidance aligns with the lower end of these expectations (e.g., closer to TradingView's consensus), it could be perceived as an underwhelming outlook by those with higher "street" expectations, potentially leading to a negative market reaction. Conversely, guidance closer to or exceeding the higher "street" expectations would likely be met with a strong positive response.

The key non-consensus information here is the *gap* between the more conservative consensus estimates and the more aggressive "street" expectations for Q3 FY2026 guidance. Investors will be keenly watching whether NVIDIA's management validates the higher end of these expectations, particularly regarding the ramp-up of Blackwell shipments and the contribution from networking.

**Contradictions:** The primary contradiction lies in the range of expectations. The TradingView consensus for Q3 FY2026 revenue at ~$46 billion and EPS at $1.01 is significantly lower than the "street" expectations of ~$55 billion revenue and $1.25 EPS, and the broader range of $52.5 billion to $57 billion for revenue.

**Gaps:** There's a lack of explicit, widely published analyst *revisions* for Q3 FY2026 guidance within the last 24 hours. Most recent articles discuss expectations rather than updated models. This could be due to analysts waiting for the actual earnings call to revise their models.

    *   **Impact:** Medium (70). This provides a more conservative consensus estimate for Q3 FY2026, which serves as a baseline. The deviation from higher "street" expectations is material.
    *   **Consensus Check:** These are presented as consensus estimates. The material impact comes from the potential for NVIDIA to guide above these more conservative figures, or below the more aggressive "street" expectations.
