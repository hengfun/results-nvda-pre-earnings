## Analysis

As NVIDIA prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings after market close today, several recent developments from its key DGX and SuperPOD customers indicate robust and expanding demand for its high-performance AI infrastructure. Notably, SoftBank has deployed the world's largest Blackwell DGX SuperPOD, while Bitdeer's GPU cloud services, powered by NVIDIA DGX SuperPODs, are reported to be nearly fully utilized, with plans for further upgrades. Additionally, Novo Nordisk has become a customer of a new national AI supercomputer based on NVIDIA's DGX SuperPOD. These instances highlight strong, ongoing adoption of NVIDIA's advanced AI systems across diverse sectors, potentially signaling continued strength in the company's data center segment.

### Structured Findings:

**Finding 1: SoftBank Deploys World's Largest NVIDIA Blackwell DGX SuperPOD**

*   **Snippet:** "On July 22, 2025, SoftBank achieved a milestone in AI infrastructure by deploying a DGX SuperPOD equipped with DGX B200 systems housing over 4,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, the largest operational SuperPOD of its kind globally. This deployment represents SoftBank's third major compute expansion: September 2023: rolled out a DGX SuperPOD with 2,000 NVIDIA Ampere GPUs, delivering 0.7 exaflops. October 2024: added 4,000 Hopper GPUs, boosting compute to 4.7 exaflops. July 2025: upgraded to Blackwell GPUs, yielding 13.7 exaflops, an almost tripling of compute power in fewer than two years."
*   **Date:** July 23, 2025

*   **Impact:** High. This is a significant, large-scale deployment of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs (B200 systems) by a major customer, occurring in July 2025, which falls directly within NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026. The "largest operational SuperPOD of its kind globally" highlights the substantial nature of this order and its immediate revenue contribution. The continuous expansion and "almost tripling of compute power" demonstrate sustained high demand for NVIDIA's top-tier AI solutions.
*   **Consensus Check:** While SoftBank is a known NVIDIA customer, the specific timing and scale of this Blackwell deployment, particularly its designation as the "largest operational SuperPOD globally," might not be fully integrated into all analyst models for the current earnings period.

**Finding 2: Bitdeer Reports Near Full Utilization of DGX SuperPOD Services and Future Blackwell Plans**

*   **Snippet:** "GPU cloud services powered by NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD nearly fully utilized driven by strong customer demand. NVL72 GB200 deployment is on track for Q3 2025 completion, with evaluation of deployment of NVL72 GB300 underway."
*   **Date:** August 13, 2025
*   **Source:** Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ: BTDR) via GlobeNewswire, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEXkMJAk7nIL0jTp1Xz8BrwLaVDBxZNgudsNeFaT9-9CUYdwcR6g24P18QH_KuTsUXs7bSEXNKjrO6Myv3n5usOvEgPUeVKoNv0Md786uZczHSG24mINCoiBI8E9BsX6eyitpbZBwH2y5Axbx_XIVeyUgRf6HziH2sL9bTHi4wHRogwSsEt5O2jCS3SZcsqDLiRPjppA39cgj5oC6abRTwVnfeUEe8HINa_WVxXQ2f-qugQPUFJ5possf1gHnl2ijA=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEXkMJAk7nIL0jTp1Xz8BrwLaVDBxZNgudsNeFaT9-9CUYdwcR6g24P18QH_KuTsUXs7bSEXNKjrO6Myv3n5usOvEgPUeVKoNv0Md786uZczHSG24mINCoiBI8E9BsX6eyitpbZBwH2y5Axbx_XIVeyUgRf6HziH2sL9bTHi4wHRogwSsEt5nfeUEe8HINa_WVxXQ2f-qugQPUFJ5possf1gHnl2ijA=)
*   **Impact:** High. The "nearly fully utilized" status of Bitdeer's DGX SuperPOD-powered GPU cloud services indicates strong, immediate demand from their end-customers, translating into sustained revenue for NVIDIA. Furthermore, the ongoing deployment of NVL72 GB200 and the evaluation of GB300 signify a clear pipeline for future upgrades to NVIDIA's latest and most powerful Blackwell platforms, providing positive forward-looking guidance indicators.
*   **Consensus Check:** Bitdeer's operational updates are likely followed by a niche set of analysts focused on crypto mining and HPC cloud services. The specific details of their DGX SuperPOD utilization and plans for GB200/GB300 deployments might be overlooked by broader NVIDIA coverage, making this a non-consensus data point.

**Finding 3: Novo Nordisk Becomes Customer of Denmark's First National AI Supercomputer (DGX SuperPOD-based)**

*   **Snippet:** "In June 2025, NVIDIA announced at GTC Paris that Novo Nordisk will become a customer of the new Gefion AI supercomputer – the first national AI supercomputer in Denmark prnewswire.com. Gefion is an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD-based system (delivered via DCAI) that provides massive GPU-accelerated computing power for AI-driven drug discovery and healthcare research..."
*   **Date:** July 9, 2025 (citing a June 2025 announcement)
*   **Source:** TS2 Space (citing prnewswire.com), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFUUyx-Iu5nWD9v1m2wupNfwdNBOI8BpTphzlRdAXIceCrEwjYf4BdNkFpbW4FLpyn6y_FiTlZ4b2iOwV6bMU8WyKV8LBbA21RzKZvCoFK1DEXcKqvW6zoApy_3TwwwX7cg7f5wPhpezJyxxe6YIT0I6BlgjstkJxq5Je2opemsqufchnPKmssjCH_Y4L5ontlR63V0E6AbRZFZ9-T1UFUookr3cl3Dhn4_dQ4eXmdgfVjzprGFzCUZ0LfbuabjBRYxMDkfOiU6Fw==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFUUyx-Iu5nWD9v1m2wupNfwdNBOI8BpTphzlRdAXIceCrEwjYf4BdNkFpbW4FLpyn6y_FiTlZ4b2iOwV6bMU8WyKV8LBbA21RzKZvCoFK1DEXcKqvW6zoApy_3TwwwX7cg7f5wPhpezJyxxe6YIT0I6BlgjstkJxq5Je2opemsqufchnPKmssjCH_Y4L5ontlR63V0E6AbRZFZ9-T1UFUookr3cl3Dhn4_dQ4eXmdgfVjzprGFzCUZ0LfbuabjBRYxMDkfOiU6Fw==)
*   **Impact:** Medium. While the announcement was made by NVIDIA, the acquisition of a DGX SuperPOD-based system by a major pharmaceutical company like Novo Nordisk in June (within Q2) demonstrates the expanding reach of NVIDIA's AI solutions into specialized enterprise sectors beyond traditional hyperscalers. This diversification of demand is a positive indicator for NVIDIA's long-term growth and resilience.
*   **Consensus Check:** This information was publicly announced by NVIDIA. However, the specific implications of this type of enterprise customer win, particularly for a national AI supercomputer dedicated to drug discovery, might be under-appreciated in terms of its contribution to Q2 revenue or its signal for future enterprise AI adoption.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding customer expansion plans. All identified snippets point to strong or expanding demand.
*   **Gaps:** While these snippets provide positive indicators, they represent a limited view of NVIDIA's entire DGX and SuperPOD customer base. There is a lack of specific commentary from other major hyperscalers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) regarding their *specific* DGX/SuperPOD expansion plans within the Q2 FY2026 timeframe, beyond the general availability of Blackwell instances mentioned in NVIDIA's Q1 report. More granular data on the volume and timing of orders from these larger players would provide a more complete picture.
