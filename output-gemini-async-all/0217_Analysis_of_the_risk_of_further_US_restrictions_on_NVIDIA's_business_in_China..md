## Analysis

Here's an analysis of the risk of further US restrictions on NVIDIA's business in China, focusing on material, non-consensus information likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

**Human-Readable Analysis:**

NVIDIA's China business remains a highly volatile and complex factor for its upcoming earnings. While the Trump administration recently reversed its April 2025 ban on NVIDIA's H20 AI chips for China, allowing sales to resume under an unprecedented 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the US government, this "easing" has been met with new headwinds from Beijing.

Crucially, China has reportedly raised security concerns about the H20 chips, with state media and regulators urging domestic companies to limit purchases and prioritize local alternatives like Huawei's Ascend series. This has led to reports that NVIDIA has instructed some of its suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to suspend H20 production in August 2025. This potential halt in production, coupled with the nine-month lead time to restart manufacturing capacity at TSMC, suggests that even with US export licenses, actual H20 sales in China could be significantly constrained in the near term.

This creates a non-consensus situation: while the US government has opened a pathway for sales, the Chinese government is actively discouraging them. This internal Chinese pressure, combined with the reported production halt, could mean that the anticipated revenue recovery from China, which some analysts had begun to factor into Q3 guidance, may not materialize as expected. NVIDIA had already reported a $5.5 billion inventory write-off and an $8 billion reduction in sales for the July quarter (Q2 FY2026) due to the earlier H20 ban. The current situation adds further uncertainty to Q3 FY2026 guidance, with some analysts remaining cautious about including China revenue due to policy volatility.

NVIDIA is attempting to navigate this by developing new China-specific chips like the B30A and RTX 6000D, designed to comply with US rules. However, the immediate impact of the H20 production halt and China's domestic push could lead to a more conservative outlook from NVIDIA than some optimistic analyst models might suggest, potentially impacting forward-looking guidance.

**Structured Findings:**

1.  **Snippet:** "Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductors. ... Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development."

    *   **Impact:** High. This directly impacts NVIDIA's gross margins on China sales and signals a complex, transactional relationship with US export controls. The 15% cut reduces profitability on a significant market segment.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. This deal has been extensively reported across major news outlets.

2.  **Snippet:** "A report from The Wall Street Journal indicates that Nvidia has directed suppliers to cease production of its H20 chip, specifically designed for the Chinese market, after Beijing issued cautionary advisories pertaining to potential security hazards attributed to foreign technologies."

    *   **Impact:** High. This is a significant, non-consensus development. A production halt directly impacts NVIDIA's ability to generate revenue from H20 sales in China, regardless of US export licenses. This could lead to a substantial shortfall in anticipated China revenue for Q3 FY2026 and beyond.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked by some, but gaining traction. While reported by niche tech publications and some financial news, the full implications of a production halt might not be fully priced into all analyst models, especially given the recent US policy reversal.

3.  **Snippet:** "TSMC had shifted its H20 production lines to produce other chips for other customers, and manufacturing new chips from scratch could take nine months, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at a media event in Beijing this week, according to the report."

    *   **Impact:** High. This provides a concrete timeline for potential H20 supply recovery. A nine-month delay means that even if the production halt is temporary, significant H20 revenue from China is unlikely to materialize until well into FY227, impacting multiple quarters of guidance.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked/Underestimated. While reported, the full financial impact of such a long lead time for production restart might not be fully incorporated into short-term earnings models, especially given the recent policy shifts.

4.  **Snippet:** "Beijing - despite its great interest in Nvidia chips - has urged domestic companies to limit purchases due to growing security concerns. There have been reports that Nvidia has notified some of its suppliers to suspend China's special H20 chip production. But Nvidia is also being reported to be developing a new, stronger chip for China."

    *   **Impact:** High. This highlights the dual pressure from both US restrictions and Chinese domestic policy. China's active discouragement of H20 purchases, even with US approval, creates a significant demand-side risk. The development of new chips is a long-term strategy but doesn't solve immediate H20 issues.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Partially known. The Chinese push for domestic alternatives is a known long-term trend, but the immediate "cautionary advisories" and their impact on H20 demand, leading to production halts, might be underappreciated.

5.  **Snippet:** "For the second quarter ending in July 2025, many analysts did not factor in revenue from H20 sales in the country as US approval came late in the quarter, while China's refusal complicates forecast calculations for the year. In May, Nvidia stated that the restrictions would reduce sales by US$8 billion in the July quarter. The restrictions resulted in a cost (charge) of US$4.5 billion in the previous three months."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. This confirms the significant financial hit NVIDIA already took in Q1 and Q2 FY2026 due to China restrictions. While historical, it sets the baseline for the current quarter's expectations and highlights the magnitude of the China market's impact.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known. These figures were disclosed in NVIDIA's previous earnings reports.

6.  **Snippet:** "Investing.com -- Nvidia may deliver strong July-quarter earnings but guide below Wall Street expectations for the October quarter due to uncertainty around China, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The brokerage said in a note this week that it expects Nvidia's outlook to “exclude direct revenue from China given pending license approvals and uncertainty on timing.” KeyBanc added that if China sales were included, “we believe it would contribute an incremental $2-3B in revenues, given H20 and the RTX6000D (B40).”

    *   **Impact:** High. This directly addresses the potential impact on NVIDIA's Q3 FY2026 guidance. KeyBanc's expectation for NVIDIA to *exclude* China revenue, despite the US lifting restrictions, suggests a cautious outlook that could surprise some investors who anticipated a quick rebound. The $2-3B potential contribution highlights the magnitude of the lost opportunity.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Non-consensus/Divergent. While some analysts are cautious, others have been more optimistic, leading to a wide range of Q3 revenue projections for NVIDIA. This snippet highlights the more conservative, potentially overlooked, view.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Contradiction:** The US government has granted licenses for H20 sales (implying a green light for revenue), but China is reportedly discouraging purchases and NVIDIA has halted production. This creates a direct contradiction between the *permission to sell* and the *ability/willingness to buy and supply*.
*   **Gap:** The exact duration and scope of the H20 production halt are not fully clear. While a nine-month restart time is mentioned, it's not definitively stated if NVIDIA *will* restart production or if the halt is indefinite due to Chinese pressure.
*   **Gap:** The specific "security concerns" raised by China regarding H20 chips are not fully detailed, beyond general mentions of "backdoor security risks."
*   **Gap:** The market's full understanding of the interplay between the 15% revenue share, the production halt, and China's domestic push for alternatives is likely still evolving, creating potential for surprises in NVIDIA's guidance.
