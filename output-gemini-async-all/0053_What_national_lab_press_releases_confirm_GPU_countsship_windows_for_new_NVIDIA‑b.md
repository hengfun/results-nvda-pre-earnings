## Analysis

As a specialized pre-earnings research analyst for NVIDIA (NVDA), I have identified several material, non-consensus data points regarding GPU counts and ship windows for new NVIDIA-based systems at national labs and through key partners. These findings, published within the last three months, are likely to impact NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report or forward-looking guidance.

### Key Findings:

---

- **Snippet:** "Fugaku remains one of the world's fastest supercomputers with 60,000 CPU nodes, yet RIKEN is adding a GPU complex that will host roughly 1,500 Nvidia Blackwell accelerators and several hundred additional GPUs and TPUs."
- **Date:** July 31, 2025
- **Source:** AIwire, [https://www.aiwire.co/2025/07/31/beyond-speed-tpc25-maps-the-road-to-science-ready-ai/](https://www.aiwire.co/2025/07/31/beyond-speed-tpc25-maps-the-road-to-science-ready-ai/)
- **Impact:** High. This is a significant, specific order for 1,500 of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell accelerators, plus hundreds of other GPUs/TPUs, from a leading Japanese national research institution. This directly contributes to NVIDIA's data center revenue in the current or upcoming quarters.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. While RIKEN's collaboration with NVIDIA has been generally known, the precise count of 1,500 Blackwell accelerators and additional GPUs was detailed in this recent article, which may not be fully integrated into all analyst models.

- **Snippet:** "Switzerland will release its first fully public large language model (LLM) in late summer 2025, developed by ETH Zurich, EPFL, and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) to promote transparency, multilingualism, and open AI innovation. Funded by the ETH Board and trained on the “Alps” supercomputer powered by over 10,000 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips..."
- **Date:** July 21, 2025
- **Source:** Pam (Weekly Digest on AI and Emerging Technologies), [https://pam.ai/weekly-digest-on-ai-and-emerging-technologies-21-july-2025/](https://pam.ai/weekly-digest-on-ai-and-emerging-technologies-21-july-2025/)
- **Impact:** High. This reveals a massive deployment of over 10,000 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS). The "late summer 2025" timeline for the LLM release strongly suggests the system is operational or nearing full deployment, indicating substantial revenue recognition for NVIDIA's data center segment in the immediate term.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. The "Alps" supercomputer is a known entity, but the specific scale of "over 10,000 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips" and the imminent LLM launch date (implying system readiness) might not be fully accounted for in all consensus estimates.

- **Snippet:** "The Doudna Supercomputer, developed by Dell Technologies in partnership with NVIDIA, will launch at Berkeley Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) in 2026."
- **Date:** July 2, 2025
- **Source:** Dell Technologies, "Shaping the Future with AI: Dell's Vision in Action", [https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/shaping-the-future-with-ai-dells-vision-in-action/](https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/shaping-the-future-with-ai-dells-vision-in-action/)
- **Impact:** Medium. While the launch is scheduled for 2026, this confirms a significant future pipeline for NVIDIA with a major U.S. Department of Energy national lab (NERSC). The partnership with Dell for an "advanced AI and molecular computing system" implies a substantial NVIDIA GPU component, reinforcing NVIDIA's long-term position in high-performance computing and AI.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. The NERSC-10 announcement was made in late May, but this July blog post reiterates the NVIDIA partnership and the 2026 timeline, keeping it relevant for forward-looking guidance. Specific GPU counts remain a gap.

- **Snippet:** "MSI has announced updated NVIDIA GPU systems that join the NVIDIA RTX PRO Server portfolio, the 4U CG480-S5063 and the 2U CG290-S3063 AI Server, built on NVIDIA MGX modular architecture. Both platforms support the NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU... The 4U NVIDIA MGX Server CG480-S5063... With capacity for up to eight 600W FHFL dual-width GPUs, including RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs..."
- **Date:** August 27, 2025
- **Source:** HPCwire, [https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/msi-expands-nvidia-rtx-pro-server-lineup-accelerated-by-rtx-pro-6000-blackwell-server-edition-gpu/](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/msi-expands-nvidia-rtx-pro-server-lineup-accelerated-by-rtx-pro-6000-blackwell-server-edition-gpu/)
- **Impact:** Medium. This extremely recent announcement (published today) from a key hardware partner confirms the immediate availability of new enterprise server systems leveraging NVIDIA's Blackwell RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. The specific configuration of up to eight Blackwell GPUs per 4U server provides concrete details on Blackwell's integration into broader enterprise solutions, indicating market readiness and potential for sales beyond just supercomputing centers.
- **Consensus Check:** Low to Medium. As this news was published today, it is highly unlikely to be fully factored into current consensus earnings estimates. It offers specific product availability and configuration details for Blackwell in enterprise servers.

- **Snippet:** "8 x NVIDIA B200 GPUs that provide 1,440 GB total GPU memory."
- **Date:** June 10, 2025
- **Source:** NVIDIA DGX B200 User Guide, [https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxb200-user-guide/index.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxb200-user-guide/index.html)
- **Impact:** Low to Medium. This snippet from an official user guide confirms the specific GPU count and memory for NVIDIA's high-end DGX B200 system. While not a new procurement announcement, the publication of the user guide in June suggests these systems are available and being deployed, providing concrete details on the configuration of a flagship NVIDIA product sold to both national labs and enterprises.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. DGX systems are well-known, but the specific B200 configuration details and the recent user guide publication might not be a central focus of pre-earnings discussions.

- **Snippet:** "In mid-2025, NVIDIA announced collaboration with multiple European governments to build AI infrastructure (as mentioned, 3,000 exaflops of Blackwell systems for Europe)"
- **Date:** June 27, 2025
- **Source:** TS2 Space, "NVIDIA 2025: Dominating the AI Boom", [https://ts2.space/en/nvidia-2025-dominating-the-ai-boom-company-overview-key-segments-competition-and-future-outlook/](https://ts2.space/en/nvidia-2025-dominating-the-ai-boom-company-overview-key-segments-competition-and-outlook/)
- **Impact:** High. This represents a very large-scale, strategic commitment for Blackwell systems across Europe. While "3,000 exaflops" is a performance metric rather than a direct GPU count, it implies an enormous number of Blackwell GPUs. This indicates strong governmental demand and a significant, ongoing revenue stream for NVIDIA.
- **Consensus Check:** Medium. This is a high-level strategic announcement that may be generally known, but the sheer scale of "3,000 exaflops of Blackwell systems" might still be underappreciated in terms of its direct revenue implications for NVIDIA in the near to medium term.

### Contradictions and Gaps:

*   **Specific GPU Counts:** While some findings provide precise GPU counts (e.g., RIKEN's 1,500 Blackwell accelerators, CSCS's 10,000+ Grace Hopper Superchips, DGX B200's 8 GPUs, and MSI's 8 GPUs per 4U server), others, such as the NERSC-10 supercomputer and the "3,000 exaflops of Blackwell systems for Europe," do not offer exact GPU numbers. This makes it challenging to quantify the precise revenue impact from these specific deals without further detail.
*   **Ship Window Granularity:** For NERSC-10, the launch is in 2026, which is beyond the immediate Q2 FY2026 earnings report but highly relevant for NVIDIA's forward-looking guidance. For RIKEN and CSCS, the systems are either being added or are operational/nearing full operational status (LLM release in late summer 2025), suggesting current or very near-term revenue recognition. The MSI announcement indicates immediate availability.
*   **Non-Consensus Detail:** While large national lab procurements are generally public, the specific GPU counts and the immediate availability of Blackwell-based enterprise servers from MSI provide more granular, potentially non-consensus details that could influence analyst expectations. The immense scale of the "3,000 exaflops" for Europe, while a high-level announcement, might still be under-modeled by some analysts.
