## Analysis

Here's an analysis of recent NVIDIA GPU procurements by universities for High-Performance Computing (HPC) and AI initiatives, focusing on material, non-consensus information that could impact NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report or forward-looking guidance. The findings highlight significant orders for current and next-generation NVIDIA GPUs, indicating robust demand within the academic and research sectors.

### Structured Findings

**1. Monash University's MAVERIC AI Supercomputer**

*   **Snippet:** "Monash University is enlisting Nvidia, Dell and CDC Data Centres to build its MAVERIC artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer announced back in June. ... Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 platform will underpin MAVERIC. It features 36 Arm Neoverse V2 architecture Grace central processors, and 72 Blackwell graphics cards that are interconnected with Nvidia's NVLink fabric..."

*   **Impact:** High. This is a significant order for NVIDIA's latest Blackwell generation GPUs (72 Blackwell GPUs within the GB200 NVL72 platform), indicating strong early adoption of NVIDIA's newest and most powerful AI hardware. The involvement of Dell as an integrator further solidifies the supply chain. This directly contributes to NVIDIA's data center segment revenue.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general demand for Blackwell is known, specific, named university procurements with exact quantities of next-gen GPUs are not typically widely disseminated or fully factored into consensus estimates.

**2. University of Pennsylvania's "Betty" Supercomputer**

*   **Snippet:** "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have leveraged AI to enhance their capabilities with a newly established off-campus supercomputer named Betty. The primary AI system was supplied by NVIDIA and constructed according to their reference specifications for a SuperPOD. ... The setup consists of 31 eight-way GPU nodes."

*   **Impact:** Medium-High. A SuperPOD configuration with 31 eight-way GPU nodes implies a substantial number of high-end NVIDIA GPUs (likely 31 * 8 = 248 GPUs, though the exact model isn't specified, it's implied to be a high-performance data center GPU). This represents a significant deployment in a top-tier academic institution.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Specific university SuperPOD deployments, especially with node counts, are not typically part of mainstream analyst coverage.

**3. Oregon State University's Huang Complex Supercomputer**

*   **Snippet:** "When the Jen-Hsun Huang and Lori Mills Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex (Huang Complex) opens in late 2026, it will host a nationally leading AI supercomputer that has a large number (150+) of the latest generation of NVIDIA Rubin GPUs, combined with NVIDIA Vera ARM CPUs."
*   **Date:** Not explicitly dated as a news article, but the information pertains to a project opening in late 2026. The document itself is a program description.

*   **Impact:** High (Long-term). While the delivery is for late 2026, the commitment to "150+" NVIDIA Rubin GPUs (a future generation beyond Blackwell) and Vera ARM CPUs demonstrates a strong, forward-looking pipeline for NVIDIA's most advanced products. This signals sustained demand for NVIDIA's ecosystem.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. Specific details about future-generation GPU orders this far out are highly non-consensus and provide insight into NVIDIA's long-term product cycle and demand.

**4. Purdue University's Anvil Supercomputer Upgrade**

*   **Snippet:** "Thanks to supplemental funding from the NSF's National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot, the Anvil AI partition was added to the supercomputer and brought online. A total of 84 Nvidia H100 SXM GPUs were procured and added to the system."
*   **Date:** August 22, 2025

*   **Impact:** Medium. The procurement of 84 NVIDIA H100 SXM GPUs represents a solid, incremental order for NVIDIA's current-generation high-end data center GPUs. This contributes to ongoing revenue in the data center segment.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While H100 demand is generally high, specific quantities for individual university upgrades are not typically highlighted in broad market analysis.

**5. UK's Isambard-AI Supercomputer**

*   **Snippet:** "The UK has launched Isambard-AI, a £225 million (US$302.3 million) supercomputer based in Bristol, equipped with 5,400 Nvidia chips. Unveiled on July 17, 2025, by Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, it is the largest publicly recognized AI computing resource in the UK."

*   **Impact:** High. An order of 5,400 NVIDIA chips for a national-scale AI supercomputer is a substantial volume, directly impacting NVIDIA's data center revenue. The timing of the launch (July 2025) suggests these chips would have been delivered in Q2 FY2026 or prior.
*   **Consensus Check:** Medium. While large national supercomputer projects often receive some attention, the specific quantity of NVIDIA chips and the exact timing of the launch might not be fully integrated into all analyst models.

**6. NVIDIA and National Science Foundation (NSF) Partnership for Open AI Models**

*   **Snippet:** "NVIDIA's support of OMAI includes providing NVIDIA HGX B300 systems — state-of-the-art AI infrastructure built to accelerate model training and inference with exceptional efficiency — along with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, empowering OMAI to transform massive datasets into actionable intelligence and breakthrough innovations.

*   **Impact:** High. This partnership involves providing NVIDIA HGX B300 systems, which are built with NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, to multiple U.S. universities. This represents a significant, strategic deployment of NVIDIA's latest and most powerful AI infrastructure into the academic research ecosystem, ensuring future adoption and potentially influencing further procurements.
*   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While NVIDIA's general partnerships are known, the specific details of providing Blackwell Ultra-based HGX B300 systems to multiple universities via the NSF are likely not fully priced into current expectations.

### Human-Readable Analysis

The research indicates a robust and growing demand for NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs within the university and research sectors, particularly for AI and HPC applications. Several key findings stand out:

*   **Strong Demand for Latest & Future Generations:** Monash University's procurement of 72 Blackwell GPUs and Oregon State University's commitment to "150+" future Rubin GPUs for late 2026 highlight significant early adoption and a strong pipeline for NVIDIA's newest and upcoming GPU architectures. These are not just incremental upgrades but foundational investments in cutting-edge AI infrastructure.
*   **Significant Volume in Academic Deployments:** The UK's Isambard-AI supercomputer, with 5,400 NVIDIA chips, and the University of Pennsylvania's "Betty" SuperPOD (implying ~248 high-end GPUs), demonstrate substantial unit volumes being deployed in academic settings. These large-scale projects contribute directly to NVIDIA's data center revenue.
*   **Strategic Partnerships Driving Adoption:** NVIDIA's partnership with the National Science Foundation to provide Blackwell Ultra-based HGX B300 systems to multiple U.S. universities is a strategic move. It ensures that the next generation of researchers and AI models are built on NVIDIA's ecosystem, fostering long-term demand and potentially leading to further procurements as these initiatives scale.
*   **Consistent Upgrades:** Purdue University's addition of 84 H100 SXM GPUs to its Anvil supercomputer shows ongoing demand for NVIDIA's current-generation flagship products, indicating continuous investment in enhancing existing HPC capabilities.

Overall, these findings suggest that the academic and research market continues to be a strong driver for NVIDIA's data center segment, with a clear preference for the company's most advanced GPU technologies. The specific quantities and named institutions provide granular data points that are likely non-consensus and could positively impact NVIDIA's Q2 FY2026 earnings or, more significantly, its forward-looking guidance, especially concerning the adoption rate of Blackwell and the pipeline for Rubin. The early and substantial commitments to these new architectures suggest that NVIDIA's innovation cycle continues to resonate strongly with institutional buyers.
