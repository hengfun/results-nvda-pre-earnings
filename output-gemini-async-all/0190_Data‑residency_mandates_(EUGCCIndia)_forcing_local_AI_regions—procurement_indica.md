## Analysis

NVIDIA (NVDA) is poised to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings today, August 27, 2025, after market close. As a pre-earnings research analyst, the focus is on identifying material, non-consensus information related to data-residency mandates in the EU, GCC, and India, and their impact on NVIDIA's demand. Recent web content (within the last three months) reveals significant and specific procurement activities driven by these mandates, indicating robust and sustained demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure.

While the market generally anticipates strong performance from NVIDIA's data center segment, the granular details of these regional deployments, particularly the scale of Blackwell GPU orders and long-term commitments, may represent non-consensus information. The explicit "sold out" status of Blackwell GPUs through 2025 further underscores a demand environment that could exceed current market expectations, suggesting that NVIDIA's growth is more supply-constrained than demand-constrained.

While the Reliance-NVIDIA partnership may be known, the specific details of Blackwell deployment for a large-scale data center, and its direct link to India's digital sovereignty, might not be fully appreciated in the context of upcoming earnings and forward guidance.

### Human-Readable Analysis:

NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings report is likely to be significantly impacted by the accelerating global trend of data-residency mandates and the resulting push for "sovereign AI" infrastructure in the EU, GCC, and India. Our research indicates a robust and highly specific demand for NVIDIA's latest Blackwell and Grace Blackwell GPUs in these regions, which could exceed current consensus expectations.

In **Europe**, the drive for digital sovereignty is translating into substantial orders. French AI startup Mistral AI is deploying 18,000 Grace Blackwell systems, while UK cloud providers Nebius and Nscale are rolling out 14,000 Blackwell GPUs. NVIDIA itself projects a tenfold increase in Europe's AI computing capacity within two years, explicitly citing sovereign AI as a key driver. These large-scale, localized deployments directly address data residency concerns and represent significant revenue streams for NVIDIA.

The **GCC** region is also emerging as a major growth engine. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, through its subsidiary HUMAIN, is making a multi-year investment to build AI factories powered by "several hundred thousand" NVIDIA GPUs, with an initial phase of 18,000 GB300 Grace Blackwell supercomputers. Even more striking is the UAE's G42, a state-backed AI powerhouse, which has secured a *guaranteed annual import quota* of 500,000 top-tier NVIDIA chips. This unprecedented commitment ensures a consistent and massive demand for NVIDIA's products in the region.

In **India**, the "digital sovereignty play" is leading to significant partnerships. While some of the major announcements, like the Reliance Industries partnership for Blackwell AI processors in a large-scale data center, date back to late 2024, they signify an ongoing and substantial commitment to NVIDIA's technology for local AI infrastructure. A more recent strategic distribution agreement with Tech Data in April 2025 further indicates NVIDIA's expanding sales channels in the country.

Perhaps the most material non-consensus information is the explicit statement that **NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs are "sold out for the next year."** This suggests that NVIDIA's ability to meet demand, rather than the demand itself, is the primary constraint on its revenue growth. This strong backlog for its most advanced chips implies sustained high revenue and potentially upward revisions to future guidance, even if Q2 FY2026 revenue is impacted by the previously disclosed $8 billion loss from H20 chip export restrictions to China.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions were found regarding the strong demand for NVIDIA chips driven by data residency mandates.
*   **Gaps:** While the scale of these deployments is impressive, specific financial figures directly attributable to these "sovereign AI" deals for the upcoming Q2 FY2026 earnings are not explicitly provided in the snippets. The impact on Q2 is largely inferred from the sheer volume of orders and the "sold out" status of Blackwell, which indicates strong underlying demand that will likely translate into revenue in subsequent quarters. The competition from Huawei in the Middle East and local AI chip development in India are noted as potential long-term factors but do not appear to be materially impacting NVIDIA's immediate demand in these regions.
