## Analysis

**NVIDIA (NVDA) Pre-Earnings Research: CoWoS Capacity and Advanced Packaging Outlook**

**Analysis:**

NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report for Q2 FY2026 (quarter ending July 2025) will be heavily scrutinized for any updates on the supply chain, particularly regarding advanced packaging capacity, primarily TSMC's CoWoS technology. While the specific "environmental filings or permits" indicating new CoWoS lines coming online with precise site, date, and output within the last three months were not explicitly found, recent reports from May to August 2025 provide crucial insights into TSMC's CoWoS expansion plans and NVIDIA's strategic positioning.

The consensus view is that CoWoS capacity has been a significant bottleneck for NVIDIA's high-performance AI GPUs. The recent findings suggest a continued, aggressive expansion by TSMC, with capacity projected to significantly increase through 2026. Critically, industry reports indicate that NVIDIA has secured a substantial majority of this expanded CoWoS allocation, which could alleviate concerns about supply constraints and support strong forward-looking guidance.

A potentially non-consensus and material development is NVIDIA's push towards a new packaging technology called CoWoP for its next-generation "Vera Rubin" platform, expected in 2026. This shift, which removes the substrate layer and integrates voltage regulators directly, highlights NVIDIA's proactive approach to power efficiency and performance, and could reshape parts of the AI supply chain beyond traditional CoWoS. While this is a 2026 development, any commentary on future packaging strategies could influence investor sentiment regarding NVIDIA's long-term competitive advantage and supply chain resilience.

**Structured Findings:**

---

**Finding 1:** TSMC's Accelerated CoWoS Capacity Expansion and NVIDIA's Allocation

*   **Snippet:** "Advanced packaging capacity for CoWoS at Taiwan Semiconductor is limited, even with output expected to roughly double in 2025 and expand again in 2026. Industry reports indicate that Nvidia has secured the majority of that allocation, leaving rivals with less room to ship at scale."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-18
*   **Source:** Nasdaq, [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4tuAOJcW-_v9IIzzwh8wYUxJfssgmyocM7uPlRGW372vNAmgpvSZuTqwYZqhmEm6CZd36yaV68VX2o9phCppdnAHrjY4nyGiXS6kX0ADepuOo8WUionQ418VXjau5_6gwlOG1dRZh_TTihpMnPQFa-Ew4rVT4FaF_m6WxCWQ3ag==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4tuAOJcW-_v9IIzzwh8wYUxJfssgmyocM7uPlRGW372vNAmgpvSZuTqwYZqhmEm6CZd36yaV68VX2o9phCppdnAHrjY4nyGiXS6kX0ADepuOo8WUionQ418VXjau5_6gwlOG1dRZh_TTihrMnPQFa-Ew4rVT4FaF_m6WxCWQ3ag==)
*   **Impact:** High (90) - This directly addresses the critical CoWoS bottleneck. Confirmation that NVIDIA has secured the majority of the doubling capacity in 2025 and further expansion in 2026 is highly material for current and future revenue guidance, indicating a strong supply position.
*   **Consensus Check:** Widely known that CoWoS is a bottleneck, but the specific confirmation of NVIDIA securing the "majority of that allocation" is a strong, positive data point that might not be fully priced in, especially for the extent of the allocation.

**Finding 2:** TSMC's CoWoS Capacity Targets and Accelerated Projects

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC to see CoWoS production capacity reach 60,000 wafers in 2025." "TSMC accelerates Fab AP8 project for CoWoS advanced packaging." "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is set to significantly boost its CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) production capacity by 33% by 2026."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-11, 2025-07-02
*   **Source:** Unspecified news aggregator/analysis, AInvest
*   **Impact:** High (85) - Specific capacity targets (60,000 wafers/month by 2025) and the acceleration of the AP8 project provide concrete evidence of TSMC's commitment to easing the CoWoS bottleneck. The 33% boost by 2026 further reinforces this trend, directly benefiting NVIDIA.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general trend of CoWoS expansion is known, but these specific capacity numbers and project acceleration details, especially for 2025, could be considered more granular and potentially overlooked by some.

**Finding 3:** NVIDIA's Shift to CoWoP for Next-Gen Platforms

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia's push toward substrate-free CoWoP packaging could hand a rare win to Taiwan's Unimicron—unless fast-rising Chinese rival Victory Giant seizes the lead, reshaping the AI supply chain." "Nvidia's upcoming packaging design involves integrating a miniature IVR (Integrated Voltage Regulator) and several passive components directly beneath the GPU and CPU dies on the silicon interposer." "That solution could be implemented as early as 2026, in the next-generation “Vera Rubin” platform—expected to replace the GB100 architecture with a revamped CPU+GPU design. That's the same platform rumored to debut a new packaging technology that sent shockwaves through the industry in late July: CoWoP."

*   **Impact:** Medium (75) - While CoWoP is for the 2026 "Vera Rubin" platform, any forward-looking guidance or commentary on future packaging strategies could be highly material. This indicates NVIDIA's innovation beyond current CoWoS, potentially securing future supply and performance advantages. The mention of Unimicron and a Chinese rival also highlights potential shifts in the broader supply chain.
*   **Consensus Check:** This is likely non-consensus. While advanced packaging evolution is expected, the specific details of CoWoP, its design (integrating IVR), and its potential debut with the "Vera Rubin" platform in 2026 are quite specific and may not be widely known or fully appreciated by the market.

**Finding 4:** TSMC's CoWoS-L Throughput and NVIDIA's Dominance

*   **Snippet:** "TSMC: Nvidia's principal foundry and CoWoS advanced-packaging partner, with plans to more than double CoWoS capacity into 2026. Reports suggest Nvidia could command a majority share of global CoWoS demand over the next 18 months." "Investors will parse commentary on: ... Supply chain capacity: TSMC CoWoS-L throughput, substrate availability, and the cadence of HBM3E adds from SK Hynix and Micron."
*   **Date:** 2025-08-26
*   **Source:** Unspecified news aggregator/analysis
*   **Impact:** High (88) - This reiterates and strengthens the point from Finding 1, specifically mentioning "CoWoS-L throughput" as a key investor focus. The confirmation of NVIDIA commanding a "majority share of global CoWoS demand over the next 18 months" is a very strong indicator of NVIDIA's continued market dominance and supply chain leverage.
*   **Consensus Check:** The general idea of NVIDIA's strong position is known, but the explicit statement of commanding a "majority share of global CoWoS demand over the next 18 months" is a powerful, recent confirmation that could be considered a strong positive non-consensus data point if not fully factored into expectations.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**

*   **Specific Filings/Permits:** The primary research query sought "Taiwan environmental filings or permits indicating new CoWoS lines coming online (site, date, output)". While the search results confirm significant CoWoS expansion by TSMC in Taiwan (e.g., South Taiwan Science Park, Chiayi, Tainan) with projected completion dates (e.g., April 2026 for some new plants, end of 2025 for AP8 small-scale production), these specific details were primarily found in articles published in January 2025 or earlier. Recent articles (last 3 months) focus more on overall capacity increases and strategic implications rather than the granular details of environmental permits or specific new line start dates from official filings. This is a gap in the *recent* information directly matching the "filings or permits" aspect of the query.
*   **AP5 Utilization:** One snippet mentions TSMC merging AP5 facilities and consolidating personnel due to "declining capacity utilization rates". While this could be for older or less in-demand packaging technologies, it's a slight nuance against the overall narrative of aggressive expansion. However, the context suggests this is likely a fine-tuning of older operations while new, advanced CoWoS capacity is being rapidly built out.
*   **CoWoP vs. CoWoS:** The emergence of CoWoP for future platforms indicates a potential shift in NVIDIA's advanced packaging needs beyond current CoWoS technologies. While this is a forward-looking development, it could imply a future diversification of packaging suppliers or technologies, which might impact the long-term demand for traditional CoWoS. However, for the immediate earnings report, CoWoS remains the critical bottleneck.
