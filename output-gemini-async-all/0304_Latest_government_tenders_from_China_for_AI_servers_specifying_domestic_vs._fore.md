## Analysis

As NVIDIA (NVDA) prepares to report its Q2 FY2026 earnings, several material and potentially non-consensus developments in the Chinese AI server market could significantly influence its performance and forward-looking guidance. Recent government mandates, evolving US export policies, the rise of domestic alternatives, and strategic shifts by major Chinese tech firms paint a complex picture for NVIDIA's operations in its crucial China market.

A key development is China's nationwide mandate for public data centers to source over 50% of their AI computing and storage chips from domestic producers by 2025. This policy, which originated from Shanghai guidelines and has reportedly become mandatory nationwide, directly aims to reduce reliance on foreign technology and could significantly curb demand for NVIDIA's chips in government-affiliated projects.

Furthermore, while the Trump administration has reversed a previous halt on NVIDIA's H20 chip exports to China, allowing sales to resume, this comes with an unprecedented condition: NVIDIA and AMD will pay the US government 15% of the revenue generated from these AI chip sales in China. This revenue-sharing agreement will directly impact NVIDIA's margins on its China-bound H20 chips.

Adding to the complexity, major Chinese tech companies like Tencent have indicated they possess "sufficient hardware" for their current AI workloads and are focusing on software optimizations to run more tasks on existing infrastructure. This suggests that the anticipated surge in demand for NVIDIA's chips following the resumption of H20 sales might be tempered by these companies' current inventory levels and strategic shifts towards efficiency and potentially domestic alternatives.

NVIDIA is not standing still, however, and is reportedly developing new China-specific AI chips, including the B30A (based on the Blackwell architecture) and the RTX6000D, which are designed to be more powerful than the H20 while still complying with US export regulations. Samples of these new chips are expected to be delivered to Chinese clients as early as next month (September 2025).

Finally, the US government has escalated its stance against Chinese chipmakers, issuing guidance that using Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates US export controls, presuming they were developed in breach of these regulations. This global crackdown on Huawei's AI chips could create a challenging environment for companies considering domestic Chinese alternatives, potentially pushing some back towards compliant foreign options, though it also highlights the increasing geopolitical fragmentation of the AI chip market.

These factors collectively suggest a challenging, yet evolving, landscape for NVIDIA in China, with government mandates and domestic competition intensifying, even as NVIDIA attempts to navigate export controls with new products and a unique revenue-sharing agreement with the US government.

**Structured Findings:**

*   **Snippet:** "China is requiring its data centres to use more home-grown computing chips in a move that underscores Beijing's accelerated efforts to cut reliance on foreign technology as the US tightens export controls. Publicly owned computing hubs across the country have been asked to source more than 50 per cent of their chips from domestic producers to support the indigenous semiconductor sector, according to people familiar with the matter."

    *   **Impact:** High. This is a direct government mandate impacting a significant portion of the AI server market in China. It implies a substantial reduction in the addressable market for foreign (including NVIDIA) GPUs in public sector tenders.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the general trend of localization is known, a specific nationwide mandate for "over 50%" domestic chips in public data centers is a concrete and recent policy that may not be fully factored into analyst models.

*   **Snippet:** "Just three months after halting AI chip exports to China, the Trump administration has quietly reversed its policy, assuring Nvidia that it can resume shipments of its H20 processors, which are specially designed to meet U.S. export limits for China. Nvidia confirmed the move in a blog post, noting it can now restart shipments under the guidance of the Commerce Department. Rival AMD also won clearance to restart MI308 sales in China, prompting both companies' shares to climb over four percent in early trading. Then, in an unprecedented move, the U.S. government announced it would levy a 15 percent fee on those very chip sales to China, according to reporting from The Financial Times and The New York Times."

    *   **Impact:** High. While the resumption of H20 sales is positive, the 15% revenue share with the US government directly reduces NVIDIA's profitability on these sales, impacting margins.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. The revenue-sharing agreement is an unusual and specific financial condition that might not be fully modeled into consensus earnings estimates.

*   **Snippet:** "Chinese internet giant Tencent has indicated it is unconcerned about whether U.S. authorities allow the resumption of advanced GPU sales, saying it already has sufficient hardware for its artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. The comments come amid heightened scrutiny in Beijing over domestic firms' purchases of Nvidia's H20 chip. According to sources cited by Reuters, regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), recently summoned Tencent, Baidu, ByteDance, and other companies to explain their procurement of the H20, citing potential “information risks” linked to U.S. government review processes. Officials reportedly questioned why companies were not sourcing domestic alternatives and warned against using H20 devices in government-related applications."

    *   **Impact:** High. Tencent's statement about sufficient inventory and regulatory scrutiny over H20 purchases suggests a potential slowdown in new orders from major Chinese cloud providers, directly impacting NVIDIA's revenue expectations from this segment.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While general concerns about China demand exist, a specific statement from a major player like Tencent about having "sufficient hardware" and being questioned by regulators is a strong, non-consensus signal that could lead to lower-than-expected demand.

*   **Snippet:** "Nvidia is developing a new AI chip for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be more powerful than the H20 model it is currently allowed to sell there, two people briefed on the matter said. ... The new chip, tentatively known as the B30A, will use a single-die design that is likely to deliver half the raw computing power of the more sophisticated dual-die configuration in Nvidia's flagship B300 accelerator card... Nvidia is also preparing to start delivering a separate new China-specific chip based on its Blackwell architecture and designed primarily for AI inference tasks, according to two other people familiar with those plans. Reuters reported in May that this chip, currently dubbed the RTX6000D, will sell for less than the H20, reflecting weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements. The chip is designed to fall under thresholds set by the US government. It uses conventional GDDR memory and features memory bandwidth of 1,398 gigabytes per second, just below the 1.4 terabyte threshold established by restrictions introduced in April that led to the initial H20 ban. Nvidia is set to deliver small batches of RTX6000D to Chinese clients in September, said one of the people."

    *   **Impact:** Medium. The development of new, more powerful China-specific chips (B30A, RTX6000D) indicates NVIDIA's proactive strategy to maintain market share within export restrictions. This could partially offset the impact of the domestic mandate and reduced H20 demand, but their market acceptance and volume are yet to be seen.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Overlooked. While the H20 is widely discussed, the market might not be fully aware of these newer, more powerful China-specific chips and their potential impact on NVIDIA's future revenue streams from the region.

*   **Snippet:** "The U.S. government has announced new guidance that states that using Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls. ... BIS specifically identified the Huawei Ascend 910B, 910C, and 910D as being subjection to the presumption that General Prohibition 10 restrictions apply. Companies purchasing advanced-computing ICs will need to vet their supply chain to prevent follow-on violations resulting from this treatment."
    *   **Date:** 2025-05-15 (Guidance on Huawei Ascend), 2025-07-08 (Copper tariffs, but the BIS guidance on Huawei is within the 3-month window).
    *   **Source:** Tom's Hardware, Reed Smith LLP
    *   **Impact:** Medium. This global crackdown on Huawei's Ascend chips could limit their adoption outside China and potentially make foreign companies hesitant to integrate them, indirectly benefiting NVIDIA in non-Chinese markets. However, it also deepens the tech divide, potentially solidifying China's resolve for self-sufficiency.
    *   **Consensus Check:** Widely known, but the *global* implication of violating US export controls by *using* Huawei Ascend chips (not just selling them) might be an underappreciated risk for some international players, potentially creating a clearer competitive field for NVIDIA in certain markets.

**Contradictions and Gaps:**
*   **Demand vs. Supply:** There's a contradiction between the US allowing H20 sales to resume (implying demand) and Tencent stating it has "sufficient hardware" and is being questioned by Chinese regulators about H20 purchases. This suggests that even with export permission, actual demand from major Chinese tech giants might be lower than anticipated.
*   **Smuggling vs. Official Sales:** Reports of significant smuggling of high-end NVIDIA chips into China (estimated $1 billion in the last 3 months) indicate a persistent demand for advanced foreign GPUs despite official restrictions and the push for domestic alternatives. This "grey market" activity is difficult to quantify and incorporate into official earnings forecasts.
*   **Performance of Domestic Chips:** While Huawei's Ascend chips are gaining traction and are claimed to match "global premium GPUs" in some applications, there are still concerns about their overall performance and ecosystem maturity compared to NVIDIA's CUDA platform, especially for complex AI training tasks. The extent to which Chinese companies will truly switch to domestic options for performance-critical workloads remains a key unknown.
*   **Impact of New NVIDIA Chips:** The market acceptance and sales volume of NVIDIA's new China-specific chips (B30A, RTX6000D) are unknown. Their success will be crucial for NVIDIA to maintain its market position in China amidst the domestic push.
