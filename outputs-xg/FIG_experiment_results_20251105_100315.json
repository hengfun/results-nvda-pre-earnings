  "report": "# FIGMA, INC. (NYSE: FIG) \u2014 Equity Research Report\n\n## 1) Investment Recommendation Summary\n- Stance: NEUTRAL\n- Rating: HOLD\n- Next market day outlook (Nov 6, 2025): Expect elevated volatility with a negative bias as investors digest Q3 prints/guidance against AI-driven gross margin compression and a sizable lock-up release on Nov 7; baseline scenario is modest downside absent a material \u201cbeat and raise\u201d and/or clearer AI monetization timing [4][5][6][11][12][13][10].\n\n## 2) Executive Summary\nFigma remains a category leader in collaborative design with strong revenue visibility, robust expansion within the enterprise, and rising multi-product adoption. FY2025 revenue guidance of $1.021\u2013$1.025B (midpoint ~37% y/y) and Q3 revenue guidance of $263\u2013$265M (~33% y/y) underscore durable top-line momentum [4][5][6]. Net dollar retention for >$10k ARR customers is 129%, driven by seat expansion and renewals under the new pricing/packaging model, which management expects to be a mid- to high-single-digit tailwind in FY2025 [9]. However, near-term profitability is pressured: AI inference costs pushed gross margin below 90% and are expected to keep compressing margins until monetization scales [11][12][13].\n\nLiquidity is strong (cash and investments of $1.6B and an undrawn $500M revolver), but Figma has a material five-year AWS minimum spend commitment ($545M) and significant equity overhang from RSUs and the impending lock-up release (~38.9M shares on Nov 7, with further staged releases) [16][1][2][3][7][8][20][10]. Given the event path (results/guidance today and lock-up on Friday), we recommend HOLD into the volatility and await post-lock-up clarity on price discovery, AI monetization cadence, and margin trajectory.\n\n## 3) Company Overview\nFigma provides a browser-native, collaborative platform spanning product design (Figma Design), ideation (FigJam), developer workflows (Dev Mode), presentations (Slides), and AI-enhanced tools (Make, Draw, Sites, Buzz). The company relies on Amazon Web Services for production services and entered a renewed hosting agreement on May 31, 2025 with a five-year minimum commitment of ~$545M [7][8]. Figma bills predominantly on annual terms, supporting revenue visibility [18].\n\n## 4) Key Findings by Category\n\n### Revenue and Growth\n- FY2025 revenue guidance: $1.021\u2013$1.025B; midpoint implies ~37% y/y growth [4][5][6].\n- Q3 revenue guidance: $263\u2013$265M; midpoint ~33% y/y [4][5][6].\n- Q2 revenue: $249.6M (+41% y/y) [5].\n- Expansion metrics:\n  - NDR (customers >$10k ARR): 129%, driven by seat expansion and renewals on new pricing/packaging; management cited a mid- to high-single-digit FY2025 growth tailwind from these changes [9].\n  - Multi-product usage: >80% using 2+ products; ~two-thirds using 3+ [16].\n  - Customers >$100k ARR: 1,119 as of Q2 (June 30, 2025) [5].\n- Revenue visibility: ~70% of Q2 revenue recognized came from beginning-of-period deferred revenue, consistent with annual billings [18].\n\nAnalyst view: Growth durability is supported by enterprise penetration, multiproduct adoption, and pricing/packaging tailwinds. The absence of pipeline coverage disclosure limits visibility into late-stage conversion into Q4 [5].\n\n### Profitability and Margins\n- Q2 gross margin: ~89% GAAP / ~90% non-GAAP; management signaled a further near-term decline on AI inference usage and investment [11][12][13].\n- FY2025 non-GAAP operating income guidance: $88\u2013$98M, reflecting near-term margin headwinds as AI costs scale ahead of monetization [12][13].\n- Free cash flow: Q2 adjusted FCF margin ~24%; management commentary and external estimates support low-20s FY2025 FCF conversion (~$216M on ~$1.023B revenue) [9][17].\n\nAnalyst view: AI cost-to-serve is the key margin swing factor. Without near-term monetization uplift, we expect continued gross margin compression in Q4 and into FY2025, with opex discipline offsetting some pressure [11][12][13][9].\n\n### Cash, Liquidity, and Commitments\n- Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities: ~$1.6B as of June 30, 2025 [16].\n- Revolving credit facility: $500M senior secured revolver (undrawn), maturing June 27, 2030; SOFR/base-rate with applicable margin; unused commitment fee; standard L/C and swingline sublimits [1][2][3].\n- Hosting commitments: AWS minimum of ~$545M over five years from May 31, 2025 [7][8].\n- Leases: Remaining 2025 $8.5M; 2026 $14.0M; 2027 $14.0M; 2028 $13.6M; 2029 $8.0M; thereafter $30.2M; PV of operating lease liabilities $64.7M; SF HQ lease extended to Oct 31, 2028 [1][19].\n\nAnalyst view: Liquidity is ample, but multi-year cloud commitments and AI inference spend reduce flexibility. The undrawn revolver and strong cash buffer mitigate near-term risk [1][2][3][7][8][16].\n\n### Product, Pricing, and AI\n- March 11, 2025 pricing update: higher Figma Design prices, FigJam/Slides included with paid seats, multi-product seats, admin controls; applied at customer renewal from March 11 onward [14].\n- AI credits: monthly pooled credits per full seat (3,000 Pro; 3,500 Org; 4,250 Enterprise), roughly 50\u2013100 Make prompts; no per-credit pricing published; paid top-ups planned in 2025 [15].\n- New products/AI: Make, Draw, Sites, Buzz launched in Q2 [5].\n- Dev Mode enterprise adoption: not disclosed [9].\n- Product attach rates by SKU: not disclosed (aggregate multi-product usage reported) [16].\n\nAnalyst view: Packaging changes are driving ARPU uplift and adoption breadth. AI monetization is early; lack of published unit pricing and per-product attach metrics obscures near-term revenue uplift vs. cost-to-serve [14][15][16][9].\n\n### Go-to-Market and Cost Efficiency\n- Sales and marketing intensity fell to ~39% of revenue in Q2 from ~46% y/y despite Config spend; no explicit H2 marketing % guidance [9][1][4].\n- Cost optimization: migration from ECS to Kubernetes (EKS) with autoscaling (Karpenter/KEDA) to curb over-provisioning and reduce cloud costs [24][25].\n- Enterprise pipeline coverage: not disclosed [5].\n- Hiring: NYC expansion to add 242 high-wage roles, majority in R&D [27].\n\nAnalyst view: GTM efficiency is improving; engineering-led cloud cost optimization partially offsets AI inference headwinds [24][25][9].\n\n### Capital Structure, Supply, and Overhang\n- Lock-up: Standard IPO lock-ups end at the open on the second trading day after Q3 earnings\u2014Nov 7, 2025. Extended Lock-Up covers ~54.1% of Class A; 17.5% of that pool (~38.9M shares) releases on Nov 7, with later staged releases (~44.4M, ~61.1M, ~77.7M) [10].\n- RSU overhang: registration covers 201,327,898 Class A shares for equity plans and 40,210,338 Class B shares under the 2021 Executive Plan for RSU settlement [20].\n- Insider plan: CEO Dylan Field\u2019s 10b5-1 plan may sell up to 3,067,662 shares Nov 24, 2025\u2013Nov 30, 2026 subject to price triggers (thresholds undisclosed) [10].\n\nAnalyst view: Near-term float expansion (Nov 7) and sizeable equity overhang are meaningful technical headwinds for the stock near and just after results [10][20].\n\n### Taxes and Capex\n- Non-GAAP tax rate: company uses a long-term projected rate of 25% for adjustments; subject to change with laws and geographic mix of earnings [26][4][5].\n- Capex: modest ($2.0M in 1H25); external forecasts imply ~$17.4M in 2026, consistent with opex-heavy cloud/AI spend [3][22].\n\n## 5) Investment Thesis\n\n### Bull Case\n- Durable growth and expansion:\n  - FY2025 revenue growth guided ~37% at midpoint; Q3 guidance ~33% y/y [4][5][6].\n  - 129% NDR for >$10k ARR cohort with seat expansion and renewal uplift from new packaging [9].\n  - Broad product adoption (>80% using 2+ products; two-thirds using 3+) and annual billing model support visibility [16][18].\n- Strong balance sheet and liquidity:\n  - ~$1.6B cash and investments plus an undrawn $500M revolver [16][1][2][3].\n- Product and platform leverage:\n  - Pricing/packaging changes are a mid- to high-single-digit tailwind in FY2025; AI products launched expand TAM [9][5].\n  - Engineering initiatives (EKS + autoscaling) drive cloud cost efficiency gains [24][25].\n\n### Bear Case\n- Margin compression and AI monetization risk:\n  - Gross margin dipped below 90% and management expects continued pressure from inference costs absent near-term monetization; guidance and analyst commentary indicate AI investments not yet meaningfully monetized [11][12][13].\n- Technical and dilution overhang:\n  - Nov 7 lock-up release (~38.9M shares) and subsequent tranches increase float materially; large RSU pool adds ongoing dilution risk [10][20].\n- Visibility gaps:\n  - No disclosed pipeline coverage ratio; limited per-product attach detail; Dev Mode enterprise KPIs not reported [5][16][9].\n- Vendor concentration and fixed commitments:\n  - Heavy reliance on AWS with a five-year $545M minimum commitment reduces flexibility if workloads or pricing shift unfavorably [7][8].\n\n## 6) Key Risks\n- AI cost-to-serve outpacing monetization could further compress gross margins in Q4/FY2025 [11][12][13].\n- Share supply pressure from lock-up releases and RSU settlements could weigh on valuation and increase volatility [10][20].\n- Execution risk on packaging changes and AI feature adoption; lack of granular attach/usage metrics increases uncertainty [14][15][16][9].\n- Cloud concentration and multi-year hosting commitments limit cost flexibility amid volatile AI workloads [7][8].\n- Limited disclosure on sales pipeline coverage and GRR hinders forecasting precision [5][23].\n\n## 7) Conclusion and Outlook\n- Rating: HOLD (NEUTRAL stance)\n- Near-term outlook (next market day, Nov 6, 2025): We expect heightened volatility, with a negative bias as investors weigh Q3 results/guidance against continued gross margin compression from AI inference and the imminent Nov 7 lock-up release (~38.9M shares) [11][12][13][10]. Baseline scenario: modest downside unless the print delivers a clear \u201cbeat and raise\u201d with improved AI monetization visibility.\n- What to watch today:\n  - FY2025 guidance trajectory vs. prior $1.021\u2013$1.025B range and Q3 revenue cadence [4][5][6].\n  - Gross margin trend and commentary on AI cost mitigation and monetization timing [11][12][13][24][25][15].\n  - Expansion metrics: NDR durability, >$100k customer growth, and breadth of multi-product adoption [9][5][16].\n  - Cash/investment balance, cloud commitments cadence, and any revolver utilization updates [16][7][8][1][2].\n\nWe would look to upgrade on: 1) clear AI monetization (pricing for credits/usage and attach evidence), 2) stabilization/improvement in gross margins, 3) post-lock-up price discovery and liquidity normalization, and 4) improved disclosure on enterprise pipeline/attach to increase forecast confidence [15][11][12][13][10][5][16].\n\n## References\n\n[1] Figma, Inc.
