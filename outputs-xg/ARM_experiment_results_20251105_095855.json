        "answer": "Public sources do not show explicit \u2018through 2030\u2019 GPU licensing commitments by major smartphone OEMs to Arm. The available evidence points to Arm doubling down on its Immortalis/Mali roadmap and Compute Subsystems to speed adoption, with MediaTek already integrating Arm\u2019s latest GPUs. Apple and Qualcomm use in\u2011house GPUs, and Samsung licenses AMD Radeon IP. Qualcomm\u2019s 2022 counterclaim alleges Arm plans to push direct OEM licenses and bundle GPU/NPU/ISP IP with CPU licenses post\u20112024, which, if realized, would tie GPU attach more tightly to OEM deals through the decade. Overall, Arm\u2019s mobile GPU licensing outlook hinges on MediaTek and other Android SoC vendors, with growth driven by new GPU generations rather than disclosed 2030\u2011dated contracts.",

  "report": "# Arm Holdings (ARM) \u2014 Next-Day Outlook and Equity Research Update\n\n## 1) Investment Recommendation Summary\n- Stance: NEUTRAL\n- Rating: HOLD\n- Next market day view: Range-bound trade; we expect ARM to move broadly in line with the NASDAQ in a \u00b12% band absent new company-specific headlines. Near-term upside appears capped by valuation and licensing volatility, while downside is cushioned by visible H2 royalty growth from Armv9/CSS and hyperscaler deployments.\n\n## 2) Executive Summary\nArm\u2019s structural monetization engine is accelerating: Armv9 transition, rising Compute Subsystems (CSS) adoption with materially higher royalty rates, and increasing data center mix (Neoverse at hyperscalers) are all lifting royalties per device and mix quality [3][4][6][12][14][24][34]. Q1 FYE26 delivered a second consecutive $1B+ quarter with royalty revenue up 25% YoY, and management signaled a softer 1H followed by 10\u201315% sequential growth in 2H, implying mid-to-high-teens to roughly 20% FY26 revenue growth potential depending on license deal timing [10][1][2]. \n\nHowever, full-year guidance was withheld due to tariff uncertainty, licensing remains lumpy, and customer concentration and China exposure are non-trivial [1][2][7][8][9][20][27]. Margins are best-in-class (non-GAAP GM ~98%; OM ~39\u201345%) and tax credits keep the effective tax rate in the mid-teens, but valuation already discounts substantial growth and execution [17][18][19][28][29][30][31]. \n\nWe maintain HOLD/NEUTRAL: Fundamentals are strong, but risk/reward into the next day and near term looks balanced with limited multiple expansion catalysts until additional CSS/design-win disclosures or a clearer tariff backdrop emerge.\n\n## 3) Company Overview\n- Business model: Designs and licenses CPU, GPU, and system IP based on the Arm architecture; monetizes via up-front licenses and per-chip royalties. Also offers developer tools and CSS platforms to accelerate customer chip development.\n- Revenue streams: License and Other; Royalty. End markets span Client/mobile & PC, Infrastructure/data center, Automotive, and IoT/embedded.\n- Scale/financials: FY2025 revenue $4.007B; FY2025 GAAP net income $792M; market cap ~$167B (as of 2025-11-05).\n- Competitive positioning: Arm is the default smartphone architecture and is gaining in cloud servers and AI PCs; key competitors include x86 ecosystems (Intel/AMD) and RISC-V across embedded and edge.\n\n## 4) Key Findings by Category\n\n### A) Next-Market-Day View\n- Setup: No new guidance post Q1 FYE26; CFO indicated a softer 1H, H2 reacceleration, and licensing volatility, which tempers near-term directional conviction [1][2][7][8][9]. \n- Trade call: Expect ARM to be range-bound and trade with broader semis/AI peers as investors await evidence of H2 royalty acceleration and additional CSS wins. \n\n### B) Revenue and Mix Outlook\n- Near-term cadence: Q1 FYE26 revenue was $1.053B; Q2 guided to $1.01\u2013$1.11B [29][32]. Management highlighted 10\u201315% sequential growth in 2H, implying mid-to-high-teens to ~20% FY26 growth potential depending on license timing [1][2]. \n- Royalties: Up 25% YoY in Q1 FYE26, driven by Armv9 adoption and more CSS-based chips [10]. Prior quarters showed similar strength (Q2 FY25 royalty +23% YoY; Q3 FY25 +23% YoY), with smartphone royalties up 30\u201340% YoY despite flat units due to higher value per device [6][28][5][33].\n- Data center mix: Infrastructure royalties are now slightly over 10% of mix (cloud about a third of that), with estimates for cloud/networking to rise toward 15\u201320% of royalties as hyperscaler deployments ramp [12][14]. CSS is expected to drive a mid-single-digit share of total royalties in FY25 and a double-digit share in FY26, with about half of CSS tied to infrastructure [12].\n- IoT: Signs of stabilization and recovery emerged in Q3 FY25 after a period of weakness [28][8].\n\n### C) Royalty Rates and CSS Uplift\n- Royalty rates: CSS designs typically carry 10%+ royalty rates vs ~5% for Armv9 and ~2.5\u20133% for Armv8, meaning CSS roughly doubles per-chip royalty vs baseline v9 [3][4]. \n- Smartphone monetization: Smartphone royalties rose ~30\u201340% YoY in recent quarters despite flat units, underscoring uplift in value per device from v9 and CSS [5][6][33].\n- PC vs smartphone: AI PC CPU royalties are expected to be ~10% of CPU ASP vs ~4\u20135% for v9 smartphone APs, implying higher per-unit royalties in PC, though TAM visibility is less certain [15][4][16].\n\n### D) Data Center and Hyperscalers (Neoverse)\n- Penetration: ARM expects close to 50% of compute shipped to top hyperscalers in 2025 to be Arm-based; AWS Graviton, Google Axion, Microsoft Cobalt are ramping, and NVIDIA\u2019s Grace CPUs (paired with Blackwell) add to Arm CPU footprint in GenAI servers [34]. Management commentary suggests server chips based on Neoverse nearing 50% share at top hyperscalers in 2025 [24].\n- Mix/royalty impact: Data center chips tend to use more IP and carry higher aggregate royalty rates, supporting a rising data center share of total royalties [13].\n\n### E) Automotive (Zena CSS)\n- Pipeline traction: Launch of Zena CSS and the first automotive CSS design win, with engagements across over one-third of global OEMs; initial deployments should support higher-royalty CSS monetization as ramps begin [10][5].\n\n### F) Margins, Opex, and Tax\n- Gross margin: Non-GAAP GM consistently ~97\u201398% irrespective of license/royalty mix, underscoring mix-insensitive unit economics [17][18][19].\n- Operating margin: Recent non-GAAP OM ranged from 39% (Q1 FYE26) to 45% (Q3 FYE25) [29][28].\n- Tax: R&D credits have driven low effective tax rates (Q4 FYE25 GAAP tax benefit; non-GAAP ETR ~14%; Q1 FYE26 non-GAAP ETR ~15%), supporting net income [30][31].\n- SBC/opex: Management gave quarterly opex guidance (Q2 non-GAAP opex ~ $655M) but no full-year SBC outlook; investment is accelerating [32].\n\n### G) Licensing, RPO, and Sovereign/National AI\n- Licensing volatility: Management widened guidance due to the unpredictable timing of large license deals; some could slip across quarters or fiscal years [7][8][9].\n- RPO: ~$2.23B with ~25% recognized over the next 12 months, providing partial visibility but not a quarter-by-quarter layout [22].\n- Sovereign AI: Malaysia to pay $250M over 10 years for seven high-end Arm blueprints to seed domestic AI chip design; disclosures indicate license upside from national programs but uncertain royalty tails [25][5].\n\n### H) Customer Concentration, Litigation, and Qualcomm\n- Concentration: In FY2025, the largest customer was 17% of revenue; next two at 11% each (fourth at 10%); top four at 49% \u2014 implying top three ~39% [20].\n- Qualcomm status: Qualcomm indicated Arm withdrew its breach notice and has no current plan to terminate the architecture license agreement, reducing a key overhang; Arm still seeks a new trial on other questions [23]. \n- Litigation: Ongoing matters disclosed with outcome uncertainty; no quantified FY impact [21].\n\n### I) China and Geopolitics\n- Exposure: PRC was ~18.7% of FY2025 revenue [27]. Arm reports US trade restrictions had an \u201cisolated impact\u201d and describes robust IP-protection programs to mitigate leakage [26].\n- Guidance withheld: Management declined FY26 guidance due to tariff uncertainty; called out a softer 1H and H2 sequential growth [1][2].\n\n## 5) Investment Thesis\n\n### Bull Case\n- Royalty rate expansion: The transition from Armv8 to v9 and the ramp of CSS (10%+ royalties) significantly lifts value capture per chip across smartphones, data center, and auto, compounding royalty growth even in flattish unit environments [3][4][5][6][10][11].\n- Hyperscaler momentum: Arm CPUs are increasingly foundational to cloud and GenAI infrastructure, with top hyperscalers deploying Arm-based CPUs and Grace-Blackwell systems, supporting a higher data center royalty mix and rates [34][24][13][12][14].\n- Margin durability: Near-98% non-GAAP GM provides operating leverage; non-GAAP OM in the high-30s to mid-40s is sustainable with scale, while R&D tax credits anchor a mid-teens effective tax rate [17][18][19][28][29][30][31].\n\n### Bear Case\n- Policy risk and visibility: Full-year FY26 guidance withheld due to tariff uncertainty; licensing remains lumpy and large-deal timing is hard to forecast, which can whipsaw quarterly results and sentiment [1][2][7][8][9][22].\n- Concentration and ecosystem risks: Heavy reliance on a handful of customers and material PRC exposure create outsized idiosyncratic risk (pricing, volumes, enforcement, remittances) [20][27][26].\n- Competitive pressure: x86 in PCs and servers and the RISC-V ecosystem across embedded/edge could cap long-term rate expansion or displace some sockets; PC TAM for AI remains uncertain even if per-unit rates are higher [15].\n\n## 6) Key Risks\n- Geopolitics/tariffs and export controls affecting China and global customers (guidance withheld due to tariff uncertainty) [1][2].\n- License deal timing and volatility (RPO conversion only partially visible; large deals may slip across periods) [7][8][9][22].\n- Customer and geography concentration (top-three ~39% of revenue; PRC ~18.7%) [20][27].\n- Litigation/regulatory outcomes (Qualcomm/Nuvia overhang improved but not fully extinguished) [23][21].\n- Competitive disruption (RISC-V adoption, x86 push in PCs/servers; Android softness risk to smartphone royalty dollars) [15].\n- Macro and device demand cycles impacting unit volumes even as rates rise.\n\n## 7) Conclusion and Outlook\n- Next-day call: NEUTRAL; expect ARM to trade in line with the broader market in a \u00b12% band given a lack of incremental catalysts today. We would be buyers on pullbacks into H2 if CSS/design-win news flow accelerates or tariff headwinds abate.\n- FY2026 operating outlook: We model FY2026 revenue in a ~$4.7\u2013$4.9B range (mid-to-high-teens to ~20% YoY), assuming a softer 1H and 10\u201315% sequential growth in 2H as implied by management commentary and ongoing royalty mix uplift; non-GAAP OM in the ~39\u201342% range, with GM ~98% and ETR ~14\u201315% supported by R&D credits [1][2][10][17][18][19][28][29][30][31].\n- Strategic milestones to watch:\n  - Additional CSS licenses and production ramps across client, infrastructure, and automotive; CSS share of royalties moving to double digits in FY26 [12][11].\n  - Hyperscaler deployments (Axion, Cobalt, Graviton, Grace-Blackwell) translating into rising data center royalty share [34][24][14].\n  - Sovereign AI/national programs (e.g., Malaysia) adding to license wins, with potential future royalty tails [25][5].\n- Investment view: HOLD. Arm\u2019s structural drivers are intact and strengthening, but today\u2019s valuation already embeds much of the H2 growth and CSS/data center upside; we await clearer visibility on tariff dynamics, license timing, and additional CSS design-win disclosures before upgrading.\n\n## References\n\n[1] ARM Earnings: Tariffs Shut Down 2026 Guidance, Revenue Growth Still Strong, https://global.morningstar.com/en-gb/stocks/arm-earnings-tariffs-shut-down-2026-guidance-revenue-growth-still-strong\n\n[2] Arm says it isn't worried by tariffs, but no FY26 guidance, https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/08/arm_no_fy26_guidance/\n\n[3] ARM Earnings Meet Guidance But Narrative Is Shifting and Questions Loom, https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/arm-earnings-meet-guidance-narrative-is-shifting-questions-loom\n\n[4] BofA ups Arm Holdings shares target, expects growth from v9 architecture, https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-ups-arm-holdings-shares-target-expects-growth-from-v9-architecture-3486305\n\n[5] Arm Q4 FY 2025: Record Revenue as Armv9 and CSS Ramp Up - Futurum Group, https://futurumgroup.com/insights/arm-q4-fy-2025-delivers-record-revenue-as-armv9-and-css-ramp-up/\n\n[6] Arm Achieves Record Q2 Results, https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-achieves-record-q2-results\n\n[7] Arm Q3 FY 2025 Results: Armv9 and CSS Adoption Accelerates - Futurum Group, https://futurumgroup.com/insights/arm-q3-fy-2025-results-armv9-and-css-adoption-accelerates/\n\n[8] Arm Holdings (ARM) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript - The Motley Fool, https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/arm-holdings-arm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/\n\n[9] Chip tech provider Arm forecasts first-quarter revenue below estimates - The Economic Times (Reuters report), https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/chip-tech-provider-arm-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-estimates/printarticle/120981122.cms\n\n[10] Arm Q1 FYE26 Revenue Exceeds $1 Billion for Second Consecutive Quarter, https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-q1-fye26-results\n\n[11] Arm Reports Quarterly Revenue of Over $1 Billion for First Time in Company\u2019s History, https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-q4-fye25-results\n\n[12] How Much Money Does Arm Make In The Datacenter?, https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/02/06/how-much-money-does-arm-make-in-the-datacenter/\n\n[13] Exclusive: Arm expects its share of data center CPU market sales to rocket to 50% this year, https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivearm-expects-its-share-of-data-center-cpu-market-sales-to-rocket-to-50-this-year-3956908\n\n[14] Armv9 Architecture Helps Lift Arm To New Financial Heights, https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/05/12/armv9-architecture-helps-lift-arm-to-new-financial-heights/\n\n[15] Arm stock downgraded at HSBC amid less bullish AI PC narrative, Android challenges, https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/arm-stock-downgraded-at-hsbc-amid-less-bullish-ai-pc-narrative-android-challenges-432SI-3541524\n\n[16] Three Growth Drivers of Arm | AI Dehydration (Bank of America summary), https://longportapp.com/en/news/206697299\n\n[17] FYE26 Q1 Shareholder Letter (Quarter ended June 30, 2025), https://investors.arm.com/static-files/782b1548-b3de-4cc2-8b25-7f949d9bbea6\n\n[18] FYE25 Q4 Shareholder Letter (Quarter ended March 31, 2025), https://investors.arm.com/static-files/a9baed37-2c28-4ac3-83b0-c11387d02bb2\n\n[19] Q3 FYE25 Investor Presentation, https://investors.arm.com/static-files/a05a1ae1-62e5-4c1c-b1dc-d5e7a53f8b43\n\n[20] Arm 20-F (FY2025) \u2013 Revenue: Customer concentration (Revenue - Narrative), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1973239/000197323925000016/R58.htm\n\n[21] arm-20250331 \u2013 Form 20-F (FY2025) \u2013 SEC filing, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1973239/000197323925000016/arm-20250331.htm\n\n[22] ARM delivers soft guidance offsetting better-than-expected Q4 results;
