For GPU\u2011native libraries, Workers AI is the forward path: it\u2019s GA with expanding global GPU coverage, BYO LoRA today, and plans for larger models and fine\u2011tuning; direct GPU access in Workers via WebGPU was previewed for local dev in 2023 but the workerd project later removed the WebGPU API, signaling no near\u2011term production rollout of GPU APIs inside Workers.",

  "report": "# Investment Recommendation Summary\n- Stance: NEUTRAL\n- Rating: HOLD\n- Next market day view: Range-bound to slightly positive trade as investors digest October partner-program updates and OCI integration. Strong fundamentals (accelerating large-customer expansion, robust RPO, improving FCF cadence) are balanced by a premium valuation and limited near-term catalysts. Expect performance to track broader high-growth software/security peers absent incremental news.\n\n# Executive Summary\nCloudflare is executing well across large-enterprise expansion, public sector momentum, and AI-enabled product adoption, with dollar-based net retention re-accelerating to 114% in Q2-25 and large-customer cohorts compounding faster than overall revenue growth [1]. The company surpassed a $2B annualized revenue run-rate in Q2-25 (revenue +28% YoY) [2], reported robust RPO growth (+39% YoY), and continues to add record-sized and longer-duration deals including its largest contract in company history in Q1-25 [7][11]. Gross margin and FCF should benefit from scale economics (peering/backbone leverage), a low-teens capex envelope (12\u201313% of revenue), and improving GPU utilization for Workers AI [1][9][10][16][29][31][32].\n\nHowever, near-term stock performance is likely capped by valuation headwinds and the lack of discrete AI revenue guidance despite strong pipeline and adoption narratives [12][16]. Competitive intensity remains high across SASE and application security, and the 2026 convert maturity represents an eventual capital allocation decision despite available liquidity and new 2030 convert capacity [6][17][18][19].\n\nNet: We see a balanced risk-reward into the next market day and maintain HOLD pending clearer evidence of durable margin expansion from AI workloads and sustained acceleration in large deal flow translating into billings and FCF.\n\n# Company Overview\nCloudflare provides an integrated, software-only connectivity cloud spanning application security and performance (CDN, WAF, DDoS, API security), Zero Trust/SASE (ZTNA, SWG, DLP, CASB, RBI), network services (Magic WAN/Transit), and a developer platform (Workers/Pages/R2/D1/Vectorize) with emerging AI services (Workers AI, AI Gateway). FY2024 revenue was $1.67B with a GAAP net loss of $78.8M; the company surpassed a $2B annualized revenue run-rate by Q2-25 [2]. The platform is deployed globally (330+ cities) with a single control plane.\n\n# Key Findings by Category\n\n## Revenue, Growth, and Retention\n- Re-acceleration in large-customer expansion and net retention: Q2-25 dollar-based net retention (DBNRR) improved to 114% (+3 pts QoQ, +2 pts YoY). Customers >$100k ARR exceeded 3,700 (+22% YoY), contributing 71% of revenue; record additions in $1M+ and $5M+ cohorts [1]. Contextually, DBNRR had trended down to 111% by Q4-24 before re-accelerating in 1H-25 [3].\n- Run-rate scale and regional breadth: Q2-25 revenue grew +28% YoY to $512.3M, surpassing a $2B annualized run-rate [2]. RPO reached $1.98B (+39% YoY; current RPO +33% YoY). Regional performance: U.S. +22% YoY (49% mix), EMEA +29% (28%), APAC +44% (15%) [11][2].\n- Deal sizes and duration expanding: Q1-25 included the largest deal in company history (> $100M, Workers-led) and the longest-term SASE contract to date\u2014signaling rising multi-year adoption [7].\n\n## Monetization Model and Packaging\n- Predominantly subscription revenue: Substantially all revenue recognized in Q1-25 was subscription-based; usage-based contributes a small share [6].\n- Platform-led bundling and \u201cpool of funds\u201d contracts: Management emphasizes cross-product adoption via pool-of-funds agreements and prescriptive bundles; long-term GM target 75\u201377% with operating leverage as more products are consolidated per customer [4].\n- New packaging to simplify outcomes: Externa (external-facing security/performance) and Interna (Zero Trust/SASE) bundles streamline adoption with predictable per-seat and pooled bandwidth constructs [23].\n- Channel program advancements: October 2025 updates added platform solution bundles and material incentives to accelerate partner-led consolidations [22].\n\n## Go-To-Market Execution and Sales Productivity\n- Sales capacity and productivity improving: Under new revenue leadership, ramped AEs grew at the fastest pace in two years, sales productivity improved YoY and sequentially, and partner-first motions began to outgrow the rest of the business [1][10][14].\n- Hiring: Headcount rose 18% YoY to >4,600, with emphasis on GTM capacity; net sales capacity expected to accelerate in H2-25 [12].\n- OCI integration: Cloudflare\u2019s connectivity cloud is available natively on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, enabling deeper co-sell and solution packaging for AI/multicloud workloads [20].\n\n## Competitive Landscape and Wins\n- SASE share gains: Public sector and financial services show \u201cgreen shoots,\u201d with specific takeaways from first-generation Zero Trust vendors; a five-year $5.1M U.S. state deal consolidated multiple tools and reduced costs ~60% [1].\n- SSE recognition and performance leadership: Inclusion in the 2024 Gartner MQ for SSE underscores capability breadth [33]. Independent lab testing (Miercom) and Cloudflare\u2019s field tests indicate meaningful performance advantages versus Zscaler for ZTNA/RBI/SWG, especially in international scenarios\u2014an advantage rooted in last-mile proximity and peering density [34][35][36].\n\n## Margins, Unit Economics, and FCF\n- Gross-margin drivers: Long-term GM targeted at 75\u201377% via network efficiencies, broader product attach, and mix shift to higher-margin services [4].\n- AI inference unit economics: Cloudflare reports significantly higher GPU utilization versus typical hyperscaler baselines (peak ~70% vs sub-10% typical) and claims up to ~7x more work per $1 of capex, allowing either lower prices or higher margins; pay-per-inference model reduces overprovisioning [16][10].\n- Network and egress efficiencies: ~70% of traffic flows via PNIs/CNIs/peering (vs ~30% paid transit) with a materially expanded private backbone, reducing cost-to-serve and improving latency [29][30]. The Bandwidth Alliance and programs like Google CDN Interconnect lower egress fees for joint customers, supporting TCO-driven wins [31][32].\n- Cash flow cadence: Q2-25 FCF was $33.3M (6% margin), with management comfortable with H2 FCF consensus and reiterating FY2025 network capex at 12\u201313% of revenue; FCF is weighted to H2 [9][1][10].\n\n## Balance Sheet and Capital Structure\n- Liquidity: $400M revolver (matures 2029) with customary covenants; undrawn at inception [17].\n- Converts: ~$1.29B principal of 0% notes due 2026 outstanding as of Q1-25 [6]; $2.0B of new 0% notes due 2030 with capped calls to mitigate dilution and permit potential cash settlement above principal; issuer call after June 2028 under stock-price conditions [19][18].\n- Share count signaling: Guidance frames dilution via diluted shares (~376.5M for Q3) rather than explicit SBC spend; no quarterly SBC dollar forecast provided [13].\n\n## Public Sector Certifications\n- FedRAMP High progress: \u201cIn Process\u201d path for FedRAMP High, advancement on Australia\u2019s IRAP, and Spain\u2019s ENS achieved\u2014expanding eligibility for regulated/public-sector workloads [21].\n\n## AI and Emerging Monetization\n- Pipeline influence: Management characterizes ~40% of the FY2025 bookings pipeline as tied to AI-related products/services (Workers AI, AI Gateway, AI security) [12]; however, the company has not provided discrete 2025 AI revenue guidance [16].\n- New monetization vectors (early stage):\n  - Pay Per Crawl: Enables publishers to charge AI crawlers via x402 \u201cPayment Required,\u201d with Cloudflare as merchant-of-record and settlement provider [25][26].\n  - NET Dollar (stablecoin) initiative: Positions Cloudflare for microtransactions and agentic payments across regions/currencies using open protocols; commercialization slated to develop into 2026 [27][28].\n\n# Investment Thesis\n\n## Bull Case\n- Durable large-enterprise momentum: Re-accelerating DBNRR to 114%, rapid growth in $100k and $1M+ cohorts, and record ACV bookings underpin sustained growth [1][11][15].\n- Platform consolidation economics: Pool-of-funds, prescriptive packaging (Externa/Interna), and partner-first execution can drive higher product density per customer and operating leverage [4][22][23][14].\n- Structural cost advantages: Superior last-mile proximity, peering density, and private backbone reduce unit costs while improving performance; egress partnerships improve customer TCO and stickiness [29][30][31][32].\n- AI as margin and demand catalyst: Higher GPU utilization and serverless inference economics support better gross margins; AI demand influences ~40% of the pipeline [12][16][10].\n- FCF scaling: H2-weighted FCF with disciplined capex (12\u201313% of revenue) provides an improving cash profile [9][1][10].\n\n## Bear Case\n- Valuation risk: Shares embed a premium growth/margin trajectory with little room for execution error. Without discrete AI revenue guidance, re-rating risk rises if growth/margin outcomes lag elevated expectations [16].\n- Competitive intensity: SASE/Zero Trust face formidable incumbent and next-gen rivals (Zscaler, Palo Alto, Cisco, Fortinet), and application security competes with Akamai/Fastly and hyperscalers\u2014pricing pressure or elongating cycles could re-weigh DBNRR [1][33][34][35][36].\n- Convert overhang and dilution optics: 2026 notes (~$1.29B) present a refinancing or monetization decision; while liquidity is ample, equity sensitivity remains a consideration despite the 2030 capped calls [6][17][18][19].\n- Public sector certification timeline: FedRAMP High and other certifications are multi-step; slippage could temper public-sector momentum [21].\n- GTM transformation risk: Rapid ramp of AEs and partner-first shift can temporarily pressure sales productivity or forecast accuracy despite recent improvements [1][14][10].\n\n# Key Risks\n- Execution and integration risk across numerous product surfaces (SASE, app security, developer/AI).\n- Intensifying competition in Zero Trust and application security may pressure pricing and win rates [33][34][35][36].\n- AI monetization uncertainty: Pipeline influenced by AI (~40%), but revenue visibility remains unquantified; GPU supply or utilization improvements could lag [12][16].\n- Regulatory and compliance: Payments/NET Dollar and Pay Per Crawl implicate financial regulation, AML/KYC, and data-privacy regimes across jurisdictions [25][27][28].\n- Macroeconomic sensitivity: Enterprise budget scrutiny, elongated sales cycles, and potential for larger-deal pushouts can impact billings and RPO conversion [10].\n- Capital structure: 2026 convert maturity, despite available liquidity, could introduce market overhang around refinancing or conversion outcomes [6][17][19].\n\n# Conclusion and Outlook\n- Rating/Horizon: HOLD; NEUTRAL stance.\n- Next market day: We expect range-bound to slightly positive trading absent new catalysts. Supportive factors include strong RPO and large-deal momentum, H2-skewed FCF, and partner-first/channel updates; offsetting factors include premium valuation, lack of discrete AI revenue guidance, and intense competitive dynamics [11][9][22][16][33][34][35][36].\n- Medium-term watch items:\n  - Sustained DBNRR >114% with continued $1M+ cohort expansion [1][15].\n  - H2 FCF delivery versus \u201ccomfortable with consensus\u201d commentary and disciplined capex execution at 12\u201313% of revenue [9][1][10].\n  - FedRAMP High \u201cIn Process\u201d milestones and public sector wins [21].\n  - Evidence of AI monetization translating to revenue/margin (GPU utilization, AI Gateway attach, Workers AI workloads) [16][10][12].\n  - Channel-led deal velocity from new partner incentives and bundles (Externa/Interna) [22][23].\n\nWe would turn more constructive on a pullback that normalizes the revenue multiple or on tangible proof that AI-driven workloads and platform bundling are lifting gross margin and free cash flow more quickly than modeled. Pending that, we see risk/reward as balanced and maintain HOLD.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Cloudflare, Inc.
