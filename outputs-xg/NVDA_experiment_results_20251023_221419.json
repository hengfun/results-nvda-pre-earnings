      "snippet": "Next Platform analyzes MLPerf Inference v4.1 (Llama 2 70B) and derives GPU/system cost to estimate bang-for-buck: MI300X is competitive with H100 on inference value, while H200\u2019s larger HBM lifts throughput (~56%) with ~33% higher GPU price, improving $/inference; Blackwell B200 pricing could cut cost per unit of inference further. The piece notes MI325\u2019s timing/positioning versus H200/B200 and emphasizes that memory capacity/bandwidth often dictates the fewest GPUs\u2014and thus cost\u2014for large LLMs.",

  "report": "# NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) \u2014 Research Note\n\n## 1) Investment Recommendation Summary\n- Stance: BULLISH\n- Rating: BUY\n- Next-market-day view: Positive bias; we expect NVDA to trade modestly higher versus the broader market on continued buyback support, favorable margin trajectory, and incremental networking traction.\n\n## 2) Executive Summary\n- We reiterate a BUY on NVDA with a Bullish stance. The company\u2019s Q3 FY26 guide implies continued rapid scaling of Blackwell with best-in-class gross margins (guided 73.5%) and a path to exiting FY26 in the mid-70% range [2]. Near-term technicals are supported by an enlarged, actively utilized buyback authorization ($24.3B returned in 1H; +$60B added) [8][9][14].\n- Demand visibility remains robust: Q2 FY26 Data Center revenue reached $41.1B with compute at $33.8B and networking at $7.3B; while NVDA doesn\u2019t provide a Q3 compute vs. networking split, overall revenue guidance is $54B (\u00b12%) and assumes no H20 to China [1][2][3].\n- Strategic positioning is strengthening: Spectrum\u2011X is turning into a multi\u2011billion\u2013dollar business with marquee wins (Meta, Oracle) [25][26]; NVLink Fusion expands the ecosystem and diversifies foundry/partner dependencies [28][29]. The OpenAI 10GW LOI (first 1GW in H2\u201926) reinforces the multi\u2011year AI infrastructure build, even if details must still be finalized [31][30][32].\n- Offsets and risks: outsized customer concentration [4], lack of disclosed backlog [6][5], competitive substitution (AWS Trainium2, improving AMD ROCm/Instinct, and certain ASICs) [37][38][39][40], plus evolving export controls. Networking revenue has been choppy (down 3% q/q even as NVLink/Spectrum\u2011X grew) [27].\n- Next market day: We see a constructive setup given active buybacks, margin momentum, and positive networking updates. Base case: NVDA modestly outperforms large-cap tech peers, barring macro shocks.\n\n## 3) Company Overview\n- NVIDIA designs and sells GPUs and full\u2011stack accelerated computing platforms for AI/data center, networking, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive. Segments: Compute & Networking, Graphics. The stack spans chips, systems, networking, software (e.g., NVIDIA AI Enterprise), and cloud services (e.g., DGX Cloud).\n- FY2025 revenue was $130.5B with GAAP net income of $72.9B; NVDA is the leading AI accelerator supplier, anchored by CUDA and a rich software/platform ecosystem. Competitors include AMD (Instinct/ROCm), Intel (Gaudi/CPUs), hyperscaler custom silicon (TPU/Trainium/Maia), and networking rivals Broadcom/Cisco.\n\n## 4) Key Findings by Category\n\n### Revenue, Guidance, Margins\n- Q3 FY26 guide: revenue $54.0B (\u00b12%); non\u2011GAAP GM 73.5%; guidance assumes no H20 shipments to China [2][1]. Management withheld a compute vs. networking split for Q3 [1][3].\n- Recent mix: Q2 FY26 Data Center revenue was $41.1B; compute $33.8B, networking $7.3B [1][2].\n- Margin drivers:\n  - Exit FY26 in mid\u201170% GM range; NVLink rack\u2011scale (GB200 NVL72) and Spectrum\u2011X Ethernet are key mix factors alongside Blackwell [2].\n  - HBM pricing: third\u2011party checks point to 20\u201330% price reductions on HBM3E into 2026, which should ease BOM pressure as HBM content per GPU rises [15].\n  - Networking mix: while networking revenue fell 3% sequentially, NVLink Switch and Spectrum\u2011X grew\u2014suggesting portfolio transition underway [27].\n\nAnalyst take: The step\u2011up in guided GM with potential HBM deflation and richer rack\u2011scale/NVLink mix supports sustained mid\u201170s GM\u2014an unusual combination of scale and pricing power in semis [2][15].\n\n### Customer Concentration and Disclosure Cadence\n- Concentration: In Q2 FY26, two direct customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue; four others represented 14%, 11%, 11%, and 10%. In 1H FY26, Customer A and B were 20% and 15% of revenue, respectively [4].\n- Enhanced disclosures: NVIDIA added KPIs and granularity (compute vs. networking, working capital metrics, supply/capacity prepayments, multi\u2011year cloud service agreements) in CFO commentaries starting Q1 FY26 [5].\n\nAnalyst take: Concentration heightens headline and pricing risks if a hyperscaler slows orders. NVDA\u2019s improved KPI cadence is a positive for transparency and modelability, but the absence of formal backlog disclosures remains a gap [5][6].\n\n### Balance Sheet, Cash, Hedging, Capital Returns\n- Net cash: ~ $48.3B as of Q2 FY26 (cash/marketable securities minus long\u2011term debt) [4].\n- Other income: guided ~+$500M in Q3 (ex\u2011equity gains/losses), reflecting substantial interest income on a large securities base [2].\n- Hedging: NVDA doesn\u2019t use interest\u2011rate derivatives; FX forwards are used for expenses and remeasurement hedges (short\u2011dated), with gains/losses flowing through AOCI or OI&E [7].\n- Capital returns: $24.3B returned in 1H FY26 via buybacks/dividends; $9.7B repurchased in Q2; board added $60B to authorization (no expiration) [8][9][14][2].\n\nAnalyst take: The balance sheet supports both capacity prepayments and aggressive buybacks\u2014a rare combination that underpins per\u2011share compounding and provides a near\u2011term technical bid [1][2][8][9][14].\n\n### Supply Chain, Capacity, and Inventory\n- Capacity and multi\u2011sourcing:\n  - CoWoS capacity estimated to scale significantly in 2026 with NVDA consuming the majority; some packaging diversified to Amkor/ASE [16][17].\n  - ABF substrates: Ibiden remains the dominant supplier (with expansion coming online), with Unimicron modeled as a second source on Blackwell; NVDA\u2019s LTAs and direct sourcing may stabilize pricing versus broader market inflation [18][19][20].\n  - HBM diversification: by 2026, Micron and Samsung join SK hynix on HBM4\u2014reducing single\u2011source risk [21].\n- Inventories and commitments:\n  - Q2 FY26 inventory $15.0B; inventory provisions and excess purchase obligations recognized; HBM\u2011specific inventory not separately disclosed [12].\n  - Prepaid supply/capacity around $4.2B in Q1 FY26; total purchase commitments at $45.8B by Q2 including manufacturing capacity and cloud service agreements [13][1].\n  - No formal order backlog disclosed; no segmentation or delivery-year split provided [6][5].\n\nAnalyst take: NVDA\u2019s proactive capacity orchestration (CoWoS, ABF, HBM) and prepayments are central to sustaining share and delivery timelines\u2014key differentiators as AI builds scale. Lack of backlog disclosure adds uncertainty to shipment timing [1][6][16][18][21].\n\n### Product, Platform, and Ecosystem\n- Rack\u2011scale and networking:\n  - NVLink72 rack\u2011scale (GB200 NVL72) shipments have begun, with full\u2011rack volumes building in 2H25; Dell reported first NVL72 shipments to CoreWeave [23][24].\n  - Spectrum\u2011X is positioned as a multi\u2011billion\u2013dollar business within a year; hundreds of adopters, including a 100k\u2011GPU cluster win; Meta and Oracle are adopting Spectrum\u2011X, with performance claims of ~1.6\u00d7 over conventional Ethernet [25][26].\n- NVLink Fusion:\n  - NVIDIA is licensing NVLink protocol/PHYs and memory\u2011atomic features to enable third\u2011party CPUs/XPUs to tightly couple with NVIDIA systems; EDA and ASIC partners named [29].\n  - Foundry diversification: Intel and Samsung Foundry join the NVLink Fusion ecosystem for custom silicon tied to NVIDIA fabrics [28].\n\nAnalyst take: NVDA is turning interconnect and networking into strategic moats, extending CUDA with fabric\u2011level lock\u2011in. Spectrum\u2011X traction opens a large adjacency versus merchant Ethernet incumbents, while NVLink Fusion broadens the platform and customer TAM [25][26][28][29].\n\n### Contracts, Partnerships, and AI Factories\n- OpenAI LOI: At least 10GW of NVIDIA systems; NVDA intends to invest up to $100B as capacity deploys; first 1GW milestone H2\u201926 (Vera Rubin). Terms to be finalized in \u201ccoming weeks\u201d and first $10B tranche tied to definitive purchase agreements [31][30][32].\n- Capacity/usage guarantees: CoreWeave agreement includes a backstop where NVDA purchases residual capacity through April 2032\u2014illustrating partner\u2011hosted AI factory models over outright ownership [33].\n\nAnalyst take: While the OpenAI announcement is an LOI (not a signed definitive purchase contract), it signals exceptional long\u2011term demand and a willingness to co\u2011invest/underwrite capacity. The structure with CoreWeave highlights NVDA\u2019s preference for ecosystem leverage over data center ownership [31][33].\n\n### Geography and Export Controls\n- China exposure sharply lower: management indicated China is low single digits of Data Center revenue; no H20 shipments in Q2 and none assumed in Q3 guide [10][1][2].\n- U.S./Singapore dominated mix: Singapore invoiced ~22% of billed revenue but ~99% tied back to U.S. customers; sovereign AI interest rising in EMEA [10]. Aggregated data show the U.S. as the dominant revenue geography in the TTM [11].\n- Middle East: Reports point to controlled approvals for UAE imports of advanced AI chips and shipments to Saudi under government-cleared frameworks [34][35].\n\nAnalyst take: Export\u2011control regimes are a persistent risk, but current disclosures suggest U.S.\u2011led demand can offset China constraints in the near term [1][2][10][11][34][35].\n\n### Competition\n- Hyperscaler silicon:\n  - Microsoft\u2019s Maia delays push volume to 2026, reducing near\u2011term displacement risk vs. Blackwell [36].\n  - AWS Trainium2 is GA with claimed 30\u201340% better price\u2011performance than current NVIDIA instances; large internal deployments (e.g., Anthropic Rainier) imply partial substitution in AWS [37].\n- AMD/Intel/ASICs:\n  - AMD ROCm progress has broadened enterprise adoption; MI325 shows competitive inference and value on select workloads [38][39][40].\n  - Intel Gaudi 3 cited by third parties as matching H100 on some tests at roughly half the cloud price [39].\n  \nAnalyst take: NVDA\u2019s lead persists on total platform/TCO, ecosystem depth, and pace of innovation, but competitors can reduce $/token in targeted scenarios\u2014pressuring pricing in cost\u2011sensitive inference and within vendor\u2011captive clouds [37][38][39][40].\n\n## 5) Investment Thesis\n\n### Bull Case\n- Demand durability with multi\u2011year AI infrastructure buildouts; near\u2011term guide remains strong despite no China H20 [2][1].\n- Sustained GM in the mid\u201170% range as NVLink rack\u2011scale and software/platform value layer in; potential HBM cost tailwind [2][15].\n- Expanding networking TAM via Spectrum\u2011X with marquee wins; NVLink Fusion broadens the partner ecosystem and embeds NVIDIA fabrics in third\u2011party silicon [25][26][28][29].\n- Superior supply chain orchestration (CoWoS, ABF, HBM) and prepayments sustain delivery share; diversification reduces single\u2011source dependencies [16][18][21].\n- Balance sheet strength and significant buybacks underpin per\u2011share value accretion and provide a trading floor near\u2011term [9][14][4].\n\n### Bear Case\n- Customer concentration magnifies order volatility and bargaining power of top buyers [4].\n- Competitive substitution (AWS Trainium2, maturing ROCm/Instinct, Gaudi 3, and future Maia) may compress pricing/TCO advantage, especially in inference [37][38][39][40].\n- Export\u2011control/regulatory shifts could constrain certain geographies; lack of backlog disclosure obscures forward visibility [6][5][34][35].\n- Networking revenue volatility during the transition from legacy to Spectrum\u2011X/NVLink may create quarter\u2011to\u2011quarter noise [27].\n\n## 6) Key Risks\n- Demand normalization and digestion cycles at hyperscalers; timing/size of large orders can swing quarterly results [4][22].\n- Supply chain execution (advanced packaging yields, ABF materials tightness) despite LTAs and multi\u2011sourcing [16][18][20][23].\n- Pricing pressure from hyperscaler silicon and rivals targeting $/token leadership in inference [37][39][40].\n- Regulatory/export uncertainties; geopolitical tensions affecting approvals and supply/logistics [1][2][34][35].\n- Market\u2011wide multiple compression from macro/rates, dampening high\u2011growth tech valuations.\n\n## 7) Conclusion and Outlook\n- Recommendation: BUY (Bullish). We see continued revenue and margin momentum, strengthening networking and interconnect moats, and exceptional balance sheet/capital return support.\n- Next market day: Base case modest outperformance versus large\u2011cap tech peers supported by active repurchases, positive GM trajectory, and accelerating Spectrum\u2011X/NVLink narratives [2][8][9][14][25][26].\n- 1\u20133 month setup: Constructive into year\u2011end on Blackwell ramp and GM mix, tempered by networking revenue cadence and any competitive pricing headlines [2][27][37][39].\n- 12\u2011month outlook: Positive risk\u2011reward. Key upside drivers include rack\u2011scale NVLink expansion, Spectrum\u2011X deployments at mega\u2011scale, potential HBM cost relief, and conversion of LOIs/commitments into signed multi\u2011year agreements. Principal watch\u2011items: customer concentration management, competitive substitution in cloud\u2011captive estates, and export\u2011control dynamics [2][15][25][26][31][4][37][34].\n\n## References\n\n[1] CFO Commentary on Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Results (SEC filing), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000207/q2fy26cfocommentary.htm\n\n[2] NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Second Quarter Fiscal 2026, https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2026\n\n[3] NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) 2026 Q2 Earnings Call Transcript, https://www.earningscall.ai/stock/transcript/NVDA-2026-Q2\n\n[4] FORM 10-Q \u2014 NVIDIA Corporation (Quarter Ended July 27, 2025), http://pdf.secdatabase.com/864/0001045810-25-000209.pdf\n\n[5] CFO Commentary on First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Results (Exhibit 99.2), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000115/q1fy26cfocommentary.htm\n\n[6] NVIDIA Corporation Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended April 27, 2025, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm\n\n[7] NVIDIA Corporation Form 10-K (FY ended Jan 26, 2025) - SEC.gov, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm\n\n[8] NVIDIA: Second Quarter FY2026 CFO Commentary (PDF), https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/Q226/Q2FY26-CFO-Commentary.pdf\n\n[9] NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 (Press Release PDF), https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/_gallery/download_pdf/68af69043d6332f1d02dec91/\n\n[10] Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/earnings/q2-2026/\n\n[11] NVIDIA (NVDA) Revenue by Geography, https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/metrics/revenue-by-geography/\n\n[12] NVIDIA Corporation Form 10\u2011Q (Quarter Ended July 27, 2025) - SEC.gov, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm\n\n[13] FORM 10\u2011Q (Q1 FY2026) \u2013 SECDatabase (Accession 0001045810\u201125\u2011000116), http://pdf.secdatabase.com/771/0001045810-25-000116.pdf\n\n[14] NVIDIA Corporation Form 10\u2011Q for the Quarter Ended July 27, 2025, https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/2e217538-c226-4d05-8f74-aaca89a21b33.pdf\n\n[15] [News] Samsung Reportedly Passes NVIDIA HBM4 Sample Test, 30% HBM3E Discount to Challenge SK hynix, https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/08/21/news-samsung-reportedly-passes-nvidia-hbm4-prototype-test-30-hbm3e-price-cut-to-challenge-sk-hynix/\n\n[16] The AI supply chain is being dismantled again: TSM.US (TSM.US) CoWOS production capacity surged 33%!
