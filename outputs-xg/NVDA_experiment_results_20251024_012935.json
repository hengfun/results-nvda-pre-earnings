  "report": "# NVIDIA (NVDA) \u2014 BULLISH | BUY\nNear-term view (next market day): Positive skew. We expect NVDA to trade with an upward bias vs. SOX on ongoing evidence of record AI systems demand, strong Q3 guidance, accelerated networking growth, and continued buyback support, partially offset by export-control headwinds and inventory provisions [1][2][3][8].\n\n## Executive Summary\n- Robust outlook intact: Q3 FY26 revenue guided to $54.0B (\u00b12%) with GAAP/non-GAAP gross margins ~73.3%/73.5%; guidance excludes any H20 shipments to China, which could add $2\u20135B upside if licenses/relations improve [1][2][3].\n- Demand visibility improving: Ramp of Blackwell Ultra (GB300) and broadening adoption of rack-scale GB200/GB300 platforms at hyperscalers underpin sustained Data Center growth; networking is accelerating faster than compute sequentially [1][2][12][15].\n- Pricing power remains strong: List pricing indicates multi-million-dollar rack-scale systems per cabinet (GB200 NVL72 ~$3.0M; GB300 NVL72 ~$3.7\u20134.0M); B200 accelerators themselves at ~$30\u201340k per unit, underscoring durable ASPs [26][27][31].\n- Margins mixed near term but support mid-70s: Rack-scale systems initially diluted gross margins, but management expects a climb back toward mid-70% range as Blackwell efficiencies improve [7][6][1].\n- Capital returns supportive: Q2 FY26 repurchases of ~$9.7B; authorization boosted by an additional $60B, offering an ongoing bid for the stock [1][8].\n- Key risks: Export-license constraints (China and other D groups), concentration of revenue among a few customers, HBM/package dependencies, rising inventories/provisions, and limited hardware backlog visibility [9][10][11][42][43][32][4][5][23].\n\nRecommendation: BUY. We are BULLISH given the multi-year AI systems cycle, networking-led upside, accelerating sovereign/hyperscaler deployments, and software monetization runway, with capital returns providing a cushion. Near-term trading bias is positive into continued deployment headlines and networking upside.\n\n## Company Overview\nNVIDIA designs and sells accelerated computing platforms spanning GPUs, CPUs, networking, systems, and software for data centers, AI, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive. Segments:\n- Compute & Networking (data center accelerated computing + networking platforms, automotive, software/services)\n- Graphics (GeForce/RTX gaming and professional visualization)\nFY2025 (YE 1/26/25) revenue $130.5B; net income $72.9B; market cap ~$4.435T (10/23/25). NVIDIA\u2019s competitive moat is its full-stack platform (CUDA, AI Enterprise, NIM), tight systems integration, and broad hyperscaler adoption.\n\n## Key Findings by Category\n\n### Revenue and Guidance\n- Q3 FY26 guide: $54.0B (\u00b12%) revenue; GAAP/non-GAAP gross margins ~73.3%/73.5%; opex ~$5.9B GAAP/$4.2B non-GAAP [1][3].\n- Guidance excludes H20 shipments to China; investor deck notes potential $2\u20135B upside if geopolitics improve [2].\n- Q2 FY26 Data Center revenue was $41.1B (+56% YoY), with compute -1% q/q due to ~$4.0B H20 decline and networking +45% q/q (+98% YoY) on NVLink, InfiniBand, and growing Spectrum\u2011X Ethernet [1][3].\n- Gaming/Pro Viz/Auto also grew q/q post Q2: +14%/+18%/+3%, respectively [1].\n- Regional mix: FY2025 10\u2011K discloses revenue by customer billing location across U.S., Singapore, Taiwan, China (incl. Hong Kong), and others\u2014implying meaningful China exposure even as H20 shipments are restricted [41][6].\n\nAnalyst take: The guide is robust even excluding China H20, and networking momentum suggests upside to mix and total addressable rack content. Any easing of export constraints could provide incremental revenue tailwinds within the guide\u2019s upside scenario [2][6].\n\n### Margins and Mix\n- Sequential gross margin pressure previously tied to a shift toward more complex, higher-cost rack-scale systems beyond HGX boards; initial dilution expected to moderate as yields/scale improve [7].\n- Excluding the H20 charge, Q1 FY26 non-GAAP GM was 71.3%; Q2 guided to 71.8%/72.0% GAAP/non-GAAP; management is targeting mid-70% GMs later in the year [6].\n- Q3 FY26 guide implies margins stabilizing at ~73\u201374% even as Blackwell/rack-scale ramps [1][3].\n\nAnalyst take: Mix headwinds from systems are manageable; NVDA still guides to elite margins as it benefits from platform-level ASPs and higher networking attach.\n\n### Demand Signals: Hyperscalers, Enterprises, and Sovereign AI\n- Hyperscalers: Microsoft announced the industry\u2019s first at-scale production cluster with >4,600 GB300 NVL72 systems; plans to scale to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Blackwell Ultra GPUs across AI datacenters [12]. CoreWeave is deploying GB300 NVL72; Nscale disclosed ~200,000 GB300 GPUs contracted with Microsoft across U.S. and EU from 2026 [13][14].\n- Azure GA of ND GB200 v6 VMs and multi-thousand-node clusters further validates enterprise adoption of NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell platform [15].\n- Sovereign AI: UK plan to scale up to 120,000 Blackwell GPUs by end\u20112026; Saudi projects include an 18,000\u2011GPU GB300 supercomputer and up to 5,000 for a sovereign AI factory; broader European initiatives (France, UK, Germany) plan tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs through 2026 [28][29][30].\n\nAnalyst take: Multi-region, multi-customer orders indicate a durable, multi-year deployment cycle extending beyond hyperscalers into sovereign and enterprise clouds.\n\n### Pricing Power\n- Reported B200 pricing ~$30,000\u2013$40,000 per chip [31].\n- Rack-scale list prices: GB200 NVL36 ~$1.8M; NVL72 ~$3.0M [27]. GB300 NVL72 racks cited at ~$3.7\u20134.0M, implying premium pricing for Blackwell Ultra [26].\n\nAnalyst take: Strong ASPs across accelerators and full-rack systems support high revenue density and sustained gross margins as customers standardize on NVIDIA\u2019s platform.\n\n### Supply Chain and Capacity\n- HBM supply: Micron\u2019s HBM3E designed into NVIDIA HGX B200/B300 and GB200/GB300 systems; Samsung qualified for 12\u2011layer HBM3E (early volumes modest) and preparing HBM4; SK hynix advancing HBM3E and collaborating on HBM4 timing [16][17][18].\n- CoWoS/advanced packaging: NVIDIA expected to secure ~60% of 2026 CoWoS wafer supply; >70% of TSMC\u2019s 2025 CoWoS\u2011L capacity reportedly allocated to NVIDIA [19][20].\n- TSMC Arizona milestone: first NVIDIA Blackwell wafer produced in the U.S. (Oct 17, 2025); Fab 1 ~30k wpm 4nm capacity, fully booked; chips still require CoWoS in Taiwan until U.S. packaging ramps around 2027\u20132028 [21][22][23].\n- Onshoring roadmap: NVIDIA commissioning >1M sq ft for U.S. build/test of Blackwell chips and AI systems; system assembly partners include Foxconn (Houston) and Wistron (Dallas); OSAT partners Amkor and SPIL (Arizona); production ramp in 12\u201315 months [34][37]. U.S. CHIPS funding supports TSMC Arizona and Amkor advanced packaging buildout [36][35][33].\n\nAnalyst take: NVIDIA has aggressively de-risked capacity with multi-vendor HBM, front-end (TSMC), and packaging allocations, while working to onshore portions of the chain. The Taiwan packaging reliance remains a medium-term risk until U.S. capacity is live [23][33][35].\n\n### Inventory and Backlog Visibility\n- Inventory rose to $14.96B (Jul 27, 2025) from $10.08B (Jan 26, 2025); inventory provisions were $886M in Q2 FY26 and $3.2B in 1H FY26, reflecting ongoing E&O reserves beyond H20-related charges [4].\n- Deferred revenue totaled roughly $2.0B and largely reflects services (support, cloud, licenses), not a hardware systems backlog; RPO therefore understates forward hardware visibility [5].\n\nAnalyst take: Elevated inventories are a watch item, but consistent provisions signal proactive risk management across fast-moving product cycles.\n\n### Competition and Performance\n- MLPerf Training v5.0 and Inference (v5.1) include submissions from NVIDIA GB200/B200 and AMD MI325X/MI300X and TPU Trillium, enabling head-to-head comparisons across LLM training/inference benchmarks [39][40].\n- Enterprise preference signals (Azure ND GB200 v6 GA, GB300 deployments) suggest NVIDIA remains the incumbent standard for large-scale training and high-throughput inference at leading clouds [12][15].\n\nAnalyst take: While competition is intensifying, the combination of performance, software stack, and ecosystem depth continues to anchor NVIDIA\u2019s leadership.\n\n### Software and Services\n- NVIDIA expects software/SaaS/support revenue to approach a $2B annualized run-rate exiting FY2025, driven by NVIDIA AI Enterprise and related offerings [45].\n- AI Enterprise licensing is per-GPU and bundled on certain systems (e.g., Hopper DGX), with Blackwell DGX requiring separate licenses\u2014supporting software attach and recurring revenue [46].\n- NIM microservices adoption spans telecom, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services via partners such as Accenture, Deloitte, and Quantiphi [47].\n\nAnalyst take: Software/services remain a small but strategic, margin-accretive layer that cements platform lock-in and drives recurring revenue.\n\n### Capital Allocation and Customer Concentration\n- Q2 FY26: $10.0B returned to shareholders ($9.7B buybacks, $244M dividends); Board approved an additional $60B repurchase authorization on Aug 26, 2025 [1][8].\n- FY2025 total shareholder returns were $34.5B (buybacks $33.7B; dividends $834M) amid substantial multi-year capacity and cloud-service commitments [7].\n- Concentration risk: Two direct customers comprised 39% of revenue in one quarter; earlier period had four customers at 46%\u2014underscoring reliance on a limited buyer set [42][43].\n\nAnalyst take: Buyback firepower supports EPS and stock, but revenue concentration amplifies demand-cycle volatility.\n\n### Export Controls\n- April 2025: U.S. imposed an export-license requirement on H20 and equivalents for China (incl. HK/Macau) and D:5 countries; NVIDIA expected up to $5.5B in Q1 charges [10]. Q1 FY26 saw a $4.5B charge; ~$8B of H20 revenue lost in Q2 outlook [6].\n- July 2025: Media reported U.S. assurances for H20 export licenses to China, enabling resumed shipments; however, Blackwell systems (GB200/GB300) require licenses to China and certain Middle East countries (D1, D4, D5) and to date have not been licensed for China [11][9].\n\nAnalyst take: Export licensing is the largest non-fundamental swing factor. H20 relief is positive, but Blackwell remains restricted to key regions absent licenses.\n\n## Investment Thesis\n\nBull case\n- Structural AI demand: Hyperscaler and sovereign deployments of GB200/GB300 indicate multi-year, global capacity buildouts across training and inference; networking attach (NVLink/InfiniBand/Ethernet) accelerates total system revenue [1][2][12][28][30].\n- Platform pricing power: Premium system-level ASPs and software stack (AI Enterprise, NIM) sustain high gross margins and drive recurring revenue [26][27][31][45][46][47].\n- Supply chain secured: Dominant CoWoS allocations, diversified HBM suppliers, and TSMC Arizona ramp provide relative supply resiliency; CHIPS-backed U.S. packaging mitigates medium-term geopolitical risk [19][20][16][17][21][36][35].\n- Capital returns: Material buyback authorization and active repurchases support per-share metrics and downside cushioning [1][8][7].\n\nBear case\n- Export controls: Ongoing Blackwell licensing restrictions for China and D\u2011country groups limit addressable demand; any tightening would be a material headwind [9][10][6].\n- Customer concentration: A handful of buyers drive a large share of revenue, increasing sensitivity to budget shifts and procurement timing [42][43].\n- Supply bottlenecks: HBM and advanced packaging remain chokepoints; delays or yield issues could cap shipments and pressure margins [32][23].\n- Inventory/E&O: Elevated inventories and higher provisions reflect product-transition risk and the potential for write-downs in fast cycles [4].\n- Competitive intensity: AMD/TPU advancements could compress pricing and mix over time; MLPerf indicates a narrowing performance gap in select workloads [39][40].\n\n## Key Risks\n- Regulatory/export: License denials or broader restrictions for Blackwell in China/Middle East [9][10].\n- Supply chain: HBM scarcity, CoWoS capacity shocks, and Taiwan packaging reliance until U.S. capacity ramps post-2027 [32][23][35][33].\n- Demand cyclicality: Procurement pauses/digestion at hyperscalers given concentrated revenue exposure [42][43].\n- Margin volatility: Rack-scale mix during new platform ramps; potential pricing pressure if alternative accelerators gain traction [7][39][40].\n- Backlog visibility: RPO largely services; lack of hardware backlog can obscure forward system visibility [5].\n\n## Conclusion and Outlook\nRating: BUY (BULLISH). We see continued estimate support into Q3 on strong networking growth, GB300 ramp, hyperscaler and sovereign demand, and resilient margins. The incremental onshoring milestones, CoWoS allocations, and multi-vendor HBM reinforce supply confidence, while $60B in repurchase authorization underpins per-share momentum [1][2][19][20][21][36].\n\nNext market day: Positive bias. We expect NVDA to trade higher relative to the semiconductor index as investors digest ongoing deployment news (Azure GB300 at scale), robust Q3 guidance excluding China H20 (with optionality if licensing progresses), and visible networking upside. Risks remain export control headlines and any macro-driven AI risk-off moves [12][1][2][3][11][9].\n\n12-month outlook: We anticipate sustained top-line growth driven by Blackwell/Blackwell Ultra rollouts and networking, with gross margins normalizing toward the mid\u201170s as systems scale. Software attach should steadily expand recurring revenue and operating leverage, while geopolitical licensing is the key exogenous swing factor to watch [1][6][45][47].\n\n## References\n\n[1] CFO Commentary on Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Results, https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/Q226/Q2FY26-CFO-Commentary.pdf\n\n[2] NVIDIA Q2 FY26 Investor Presentation, https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/NVDA-F2Q26-Quarterly-Presentation-FINAL.pdf\n\n[3] NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Second Quarter Fiscal 2026, https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2026\n\n[4] NVIDIA CORP Form 10-Q (Q2 FY2026) \u2013 Jul 27, 2025, http://pdf.secdatabase.com/864/0001045810-25-000209.pdf\n\n[5] nvda-20250727 - SEC.gov, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm\n\n[6] NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026, https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2026\n\n[7] Q4FY25 CFO Commentary, https://investor.nvidia.com/files/doc_financials/2025/Q425/Q4FY25-CFO-Commentary.pdf\n\n[8] NVIDIA Corporation Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended July 27, 2025, https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/2e217538-c226-4d05-8f74-aaca89a21b33.pdf\n\n[9] NVIDIA Proxy Statement (Export Controls Note: Blackwell requires licenses), https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/67066G/20250428/COMBO_608916/129.html\n\n[10] nvda-20250409 - SEC.gov, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000082/nvda-20250409.htm\n\n[11] Nvidia says it will restart sales of a key AI chip to China, in a reversal of US restrictions, https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/business/nvidia-resume-h20-chip-sales-to-china-intl-hnk\n\n[12] Microsoft Azure delivers the first large scale cluster with NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 for OpenAI workloads, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-delivers-the-first-large-scale-cluster-with-nvidia-gb300-nvl72-for-openai-workloads/\n\n[13] CoreWeave Becomes First Hyperscaler to Deploy NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Platform, https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Becomes-First-Hyperscaler-to-Deploy-NVIDIA-GB300-NVL72-Platform/default.aspx\n\n[14] Nscale Contracts Approximately 200,000 NVIDIA GB300 GPUs with Microsoft, https://www.nscale.com/press-releases/nscale-microsoft-2025\n\n[15] Accelerating the Intelligence Age with Azure AI Infrastructure and the GA of ND GB200 v6, https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurehighperformancecomputingblog/accelerating-the-intelligence-age-with-azure-ai-infrastructure-and-the-ga-of-nd-/4394575\n\n[16] Micron Innovates From the Data Center to the Edge With NVIDIA, https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-innovates-data-center-edge-nvidia\n\n[17] Samsung clears Nvidia hurdle for 12-layer HBM3E supply, setting stage for HBM4 battle, https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-chipmakers/newsView/ked202509190008\n\n[18] Nvidia asks SK Hynix to bring forward HBM4 supply by 6 months, https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-chipmakers/newsView/ked202411040011\n\n[19] Nvidia expected to take 60% of CoWoS wafer supply by 2026, TSMC to expand packaging in U.S., https://www.semimedia.cc/19561.html\n\n[20] [News] TSMC Reportedly Sees CoWoS Order Surge, with NVIDIA Securing 70% of 2025 CoWoS-L Capacity, https://www.trendforce.com/news/news/2025/02/24/news-tsmc-reportedly-sees-cowos-order-surge-with-nvidia-securing-70-of-2025-cowos-l-capacity/\n\n[21] The Engines of American-Made Intelligence: NVIDIA and TSMC Celebrate First NVIDIA Blackwell Wafer Produced in the US, https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tsmc-blackwell-manufacturing/\n\n[22] [News] TSMC Arizona Delivers 2Q25 Investment Income;
